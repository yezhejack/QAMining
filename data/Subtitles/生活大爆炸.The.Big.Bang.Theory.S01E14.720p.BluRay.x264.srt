1
00:00:02,808 --> 00:00:06,328
这三明治真是个彻底的失败品
This sandwich is an unmitigated disaster.

2
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:08,418
我点的是火鸡和烤牛肉
I asked for turkey and roast beef

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:10,358
全麦上放生菜和芝士
With lettuce and swiss on whole wheat.

4
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:11,158
那他们给你的什么?
What did they give you?

5
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:12,388
火鸡和烤牛肉
Turkey and roast beef

6
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:15,188
全麦上放的芝士和生菜
With swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.

7
00:00:19,738 --> 00:00:23,188
东西确实一样  但是顺序不对啊
It's the right ingredients, but in the wrong order.

8
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:25,518
一个合格的三明治
In a proper sandwich,

9
00:00:25,738 --> 00:00:27,418
它的芝士要紧贴着面包
The cheese is adjacent to the bread

10
00:00:27,638 --> 00:00:30,488
这样会提供给生菜一个有水分的屏障
To create a moisture barrier against the lettuce.

11
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:34,288
他们可能带着这玩意过了一趟洗车房
They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.

12
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:36,258
不太可能吧
I don't believe it.

13
00:00:36,468 --> 00:00:38,158
我知道  这是很基本的烹饪知识
I know. it's basic culinary science.

14
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:41,288
有人拍卖了一个原版电影里用过的时间机器道具
Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop

15
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,888
但竟然没人竞拍
From the original film, and no one is bidding on it.

16
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:46,818
电影"时间机器"里的时间机器?
A time machine from the movie the time machine?

17
00:00:47,038 --> 00:00:50,688
不  是"苏菲的选择"里的时间机器
No. a time machine from sophie's choice.

18
00:00:50,908 --> 00:00:53,218
厉害  苏菲在电影里是用过一个时间机器
Boy, sophie could have used a time machine in that movie.

19
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:55,518
你见过吗?  挺刚猛啊
Did you see it? it's rough.

20
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:57,618
酷毙了
Oh, that's cool.

21
00:00:57,838 --> 00:00:59,658
只要800美金?
It's only $800?

22
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:01,118
没错  那是我出的价钱
Yeah. and that's my bid.

23
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:02,458
你出价800美元?
You bid $800?

24
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:04,118
我没多想一时定下的嘛
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

25
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:05,618
我想它怎么都会飙到上千的
I figured it would go for thousands,

26
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:07,518
我只是想参与一下而已
And I just wanted to be a part of it.

27
00:01:07,738 --> 00:01:09,658
拍卖还剩30秒就结束了
There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.

28
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:10,818
你有800美金吗?
Do you have $800?

29
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:13,188
撼动不了这台小型时间机器
Not to blow on a miniature time machine.

30
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:14,458
别担心  一般大家都是
Well, don't worry. the way these things work

31
00:01:14,668 --> 00:01:15,918
等到最后一秒钟
Is people wait until the last second to bid,

32
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:17,758
然后突然杀进来把它拍走  这就叫淘宝
And then they swoop in and get it. it's called sniping.

33
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:18,988
15秒
15 seconds.

34
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,558
快点啊  淘宝人
Come on, snipers.

35
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:24,258
10  9  8...
Ten, nine, eight...

36
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:25,888
你的淘宝人呢?
Where are your snipers?

37
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:27,818
5  淘啊
Five... snipe.

38
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:28,818
4  淘啊
Four... snipe.

39
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:29,888
3  淘啊
Three... snipe!

40
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:30,958
2  淘啊
Two... snipe!

41
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:32,418
1
One...

42
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:34,388
祝贺你
Congratulations!

43
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:37,058
你光荣地成为这台小型时间机器的主人了
You are the proud owner of a miniature time machine!

44
00:01:38,538 --> 00:01:40,088
你个幸运的家伙
You lucky duck.

45
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,258
我想不通怎么没人竞拍了
I wonder why no one else bid.

46
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:44,688
这是部经典高科技电影里很有纪念意义的东西啊
This is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia.

47
00:01:44,908 --> 00:01:46,588
我知道  可我仍然没钱买它
Yeah, I know! I still can't afford it.

48
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:47,888
要不我们一起凑钱吧?
Why don't we share it?

49
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,318
我们每人出200
We'll each put in 200 bucks, and we'll

50
00:01:49,538 --> 00:01:51,088
然后我们轮流把它放家里
Take turns having it in our house.

51
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:53,188
一个时间共享的时间机器
A time-share time machine.

52
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,588
我同意  谢尔顿?
I'm in. sheldon?

53
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:57,688
还用你问吗?
Need you ask?

54
00:01:57,908 --> 00:02:00,158
可我还是不明白怎么就没人出价
I still don't understand why no one else bid.

55
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:12,258
我明白为什么没人出价了
I understand why no one else bid.

56
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:33,635
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第14集
The.Nerdvana.Annihilation

57
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:42,797
那单子上确实有写是小型的吗?
Did the listing actually say "miniature"?

58
00:02:44,477 --> 00:02:46,757
我也在想
I just assumed.

59
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:51,797
谁会800块就卖一个完整尺寸的时间机器啊?
Who sells a full-size time machine for $800?

60
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:56,357
某人肯定处于两块韦恩集合图的交集
In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located

61
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:57,727
一张集合图写着"不再需要时间机器"
Within the intersection of the sets "no longer want my time machine"

62
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:00,897
另一张写着"急需800块"
And "need $800."

63
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:03,327
这个价钱的确非常低了
It's actually a tremendous bargain.

64
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:04,397
就算加上运费
Even with shipping, it works out

65
00:03:04,607 --> 00:03:07,327
算下来平均每磅不到4美金呢
To less than four dollars a pound.

66
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:10,957
调味酱稣虾是12块5
Cocktail shrimp are $12.50.

67
00:03:11,177 --> 00:03:13,627
我们怎么把这玩意弄上楼?
How are we going to get it upstairs?

68
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:16,557
如果把这个盘子取下来
If we take the dish off,

69
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:18,057
应该能放进电梯里
It might fit in the elevator.

70
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:21,127
对  可是电梯都坏了2年了
Yes, but the elevator has been broken for two years.

71
00:03:21,347 --> 00:03:22,457
我曾经想问过你
I've been meaning to ask you.

72
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,627
你说我们是不是该打个电话呢
Do you think we should make a call about that?

73
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,597
没必要
Not necessary.

74
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,327
我是工程学硕士
I have a master's in engineering.

75
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:32,057
我闭眼都能远程修复卫星
I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis.

76
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:35,597
我还能检修航天飞机载弹头
I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads.

77
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:39,057
当火星探测器开始向左行驶时
When the mars rover started pulling to the left, I performed

78
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:43,497
我在6200万英里以外进行用户接口联合
A front-end alignment from 62 million miles away.

79
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:55,227
不  这宝贝已经坏了
No. that baby's broken.

80
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,290
加油啊  伙计们  用力推!
Come on, guys! push!

81
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:00,486
如果我再用力
If I push any harder,

82
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:03,616
就快把结肠给"分娩"出来了
I'm going to give birth to my colon.

83
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,546
我手指都快没知觉了  快点!
I can't feel my fingers. hurry up!

84
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:06,616
不管多快
It's the same amount of work

85
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:07,946
工作量都是一样的
No matter how fast you go.

86
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,116
基本的物理原理
Basic physics.

87
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:09,946
-谢尔顿?  -干嘛?
Sheldon? yeah?

88
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,946
如果我的手指以后还能用
If my fingers ever work again,

89
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,446
我想我的中指以后有活干了
I've got a job for the middle one.

90
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,946
好  各位
Oh. hey, guys.

91
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,246
你好  佩妮
Oh. hi, penny.

92
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:22,316
休息一会吧
Take a break, guys.

93
00:04:22,536 --> 00:04:24,016
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

94
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:26,486
我们在...搬点东西上来
We're just, you know, moving something upstairs.

95
00:04:26,696 --> 00:04:27,486
什么东西
What is it?

96
00:04:27,696 --> 00:04:31,146
就是个...时间机器
Just... you know. time machine.

97
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,746
好的  不错  但我要赶去工作了  所以...
Yeah. okay. neat. but I really got to get to work.

98
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:35,616
-再给我们几分钟  -我等不了几分钟
Just give us a few minutes. I don't have a few minutes.

99
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:36,816
我已经晚了
I'm running really late.

100
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:38,716
我有个简单的办法
Then, I have a simple solution.

101
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:40,986
去到楼顶  跳到另一栋楼顶上
Go up to the roof. hop over to the next building.

102
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:42,416
中间离得不远
There's a small gap--

103
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:44,316
如果你容易晕就别往下看
Don't look down if you're subject to vertigo--

104
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:45,486
然后走他们的楼梯井
And use their stairwell.

105
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:47,086
你逗我玩呢  是吧?
You're joking, right?

106
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:49,146
跟头晕有关的东西我从不开玩笑
Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.

107
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:54,786
该死  好吧  我去房顶看看
Damn. okay, I'll just take the roof.

108
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,686
如果你能等我们把时间机器都弄好了
Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine,

109
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,746
我可以把你送回到昨天上班时
I can drop you off at work yesterday.

110
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:03,016
时光旅行  开个玩笑...别介意
Time travel joke. it's not... never mind.

111
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:07,446
从它的用途来看  我觉得还是挺好笑的
For what it's worth, I thought it was humorous.

112
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:12,846
还是接着搬吧
Let's just do this.

113
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:14,286
兄弟们准备好推了没?
You guys ready to push?

114
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:15,546
马上
In a minute.

115
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:18,586
霍华德到外面去吐了
Howard stepped outside to throw up.

116
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,086
我不懂你到底在担心什么
I don't know what you were worried about.

117
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:26,986
我觉得他放在房间里肯定能行
I think it really works in the room.

118
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,216
是啊
Yeah.

119
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:31,046
这绝对是我拥有过的
It is by far the coolest thing

120
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:32,386
最酷的东西
I have ever owned.

121
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:35,246
那个载着演员罗德・泰勒
The exact time machine that carried actor rod taylor

122
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:36,646
从维多利亚时代的英格兰
From victorian england

123
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:38,586
到临近未来世界末日的时间机器
Into the post-apocalyptic future,

124
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,816
那个社会分裂成两个派系
Where society had splintered into the two factions

125
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:43,416
居住在地下的"莫洛克"
The subterranean morlocks, who survived by feasting

126
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,416
他们靠吃住在地表的"埃洛依"维生
On the flesh of the gentle surface-dwelling eloi.

127
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:50,616
真是性感的万人迷啊
Talk about your chick magnets.

128
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:53,846
是  没错
Oh, yeah.

129
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,986
那个住我旁隔壁的家伙总是
The guy who lives next to me is always like,

130
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:57,586
"我的阳台上有个水流按摩浴缸
"i have a jacuzzi on my balcony.

131
00:05:57,796 --> 00:05:59,546
我的阳台上有个水流按摩浴缸"
I have a jacuzzi on my balcony."

132
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:01,016
可等着看我告诉他
But wait until I tell him,

133
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,446
"我的阳台上有一台时间机器
"i've got a time machine on my balcony.

134
00:06:04,836 --> 00:06:07,186
把泳裤裹裹紧吧  按摩浴缸"
Stuff that in your speedo, jacuzzi bob."

135
00:06:08,596 --> 00:06:10,486
先生们  我知道我们说好是轮流拥有它
Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns,

136
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:11,616
但我想你们会认同说
But I think you'll agree

137
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:14,016
实际上就意味着它是留在这儿的
That practicality dictates it remain here.

138
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:15,586
你不能就这么独吞了
You can't just keep it here.

139
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:16,846
假如我碰到个小妞然后跟她说
What if I meet a girl and say,

140
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,416
"你想上去看看我的时间机器吗
"you want to come up and see my time machine?

141
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:19,686
它在我朋友家里"
It's at my friends' house."

142
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:21,616
多丢人啊!
How lame is that?

143
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:23,346
-他说的对  -好吧
He's got a point. all right,

144
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:25,786
我觉得我们该订些基本原则
I think we're going to need some ground rules; in addition

145
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:27,386
除了"进时间机器禁止穿鞋"
To the expected "no shoes in the time machine,"

146
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,286
以及"时间机器内禁止饮食"
And "no eating in the time machine,"

147
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:31,146
我还建议"进时间机器
I propose we add "pants must be worn

148
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,746
必须要穿裤子'
At all times in the time machine."

149
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:35,946
赞成!
Seconded.

150
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,646
我还准备在里面放条毛巾呢
I was going to put down a towel.

151
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,316
我还是希望它能放在我的阳台上
I still want it on my balcony.

152
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,746
我说我们就两月轮一次(或一月轮两次)吧
I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.

153
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:46,916
是啊  听上去挺公平
Yeah, that sounds fair.

154
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:48,886
等等  两月轮一次很模棱两可啊
Hold on, bi-monthly is an ambiguous term.

155
00:06:49,096 --> 00:06:50,886
意思是每两月搬一次还是每个月搬两次?
Do you mean move it every other month or twice a month?

156
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:52,286
-一月两次  -那就不行
Twice a month. then no.

157
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:53,786
那好  两月一次
Okay, every other month.

158
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:54,986
还是不行
No.

159
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:57,746
谢尔顿  你不能这么自私!
Sheldon, you can't be selfish.

160
00:06:57,966 --> 00:07:00,246
我们都付了钱  所以它是大家的
We all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us.

161
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:02,246
现在快让开  别挡着我进我的时间机器
Now get out of the way so I can sit in my time machine.

162
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:17,116
好的  我设置时间到1876年3月10日
Okay, I am setting the dials for march 10, 1876.

163
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,916
好主意  亚历山大・格雷厄姆・贝尔
Good choice, alexander graham bell

164
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,016
发明了电话并打给了沃森博士
Invents the telephone and calls out for dr. watson.

165
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:22,986
等等  我也想看看这个场面
Wait a minute. I'd want to see that, too.

166
00:07:23,196 --> 00:07:24,516
轮到你的时候  随你想干嘛
So when it's your turn, you can.

167
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,416
不过如果我们都去同一个时间点
But if we all go back to the same point in time,

168
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:28,386
贝尔的实验室就太挤了
Bell's lab is going to get very crowded.

169
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:29,516
他就会知道有大事发生了
He'll know something's up.

170
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:32,646
而且时间机器不会进行空间上的位移
Also since the time machine doesn't move in space,

171
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,186
所以你会"降临"在1876年的帕萨迪纳
You'll end up in 1876 pasadena.

172
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:37,116
即使你降临在了波士顿  你又能干嘛呢
And even if you can make it to boston, what are you going to do?

173
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:38,286
敲贝尔的门跟贝尔夫人说
Knock on the door and say to mrs. bell,

174
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:39,916
"嘿  贝尔夫人  我是你老公的疯狂粉丝
"hey, mrs. bell. big fan of your husband.

175
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:42,686
我能进来参观他发明电话吗?"
Can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?"

176
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:43,846
贝尔夫人是个聋子
Mrs. bell was deaf.

177
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:45,186
她甚至不会听到你敲门
She's not even going to hear you knock.

178
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,016
我有个办法
I have a solution.

179
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:51,286
首先去到未来弄一个隐身装置
First, go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.

180
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:52,316
多远的未来?
Ooh, how far into the future?

181
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:53,486
如果我没记错的话
If I remember correctly,

182
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:55,346
柯克舰长会在星际纪年5027.3
Captain kirk will steal a cloaking device

183
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:58,346
从罗姆兰偷走一个隐身装置(出自"星际迷航"系列)
From the romulans on stardate 5027.3,

184
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:01,816
之后被'先锋联盟舰队'于2328年1月10日所截获
Which would be january 10, 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.

185
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:08,416
好吧  那我把时间设到2328年1月10日
Okay, I am setting the dials for january 10, 2328.

186
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:11,916
向未来  出发
Here we go into the future.

187
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:33,416
真有意思
That was fun.

188
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:35,946
轮到我了
My turn!

189
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:39,116
首先
Okay, first of all,

190
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:41,616
那段你声称仅三英尺宽的距离
What you call a gap was nearly three feet wide.

191
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:43,446
-让我滑倒摔伤了我的膝盖  -你还好吧?
I slipped and skinned my knee. are you okay?

192
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:46,486
其次  那扇通往旁边那幢楼的
Second of all, the door to the stairwell

193
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:47,746
楼梯井门是锁着的
Of the other building was locked,

194
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,216
所以我不得不从防火梯下楼
So I had to go down the fire escape,

195
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:50,346
可那只是到三楼的
Which ends on the third floor,

196
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:51,986
逼我只能从一个"可爱"的亚美尼亚家庭
Forcing me to crawl through the window

197
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:53,646
的窗户爬了进去
Of a lovely armenian family

198
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,016
他们还强留了我吃午饭
Who insisted I stay for lunch.

199
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,916
听起来还不坏嘛
That doesn't sound too bad.

200
00:08:58,136 --> 00:08:59,616
那是整整八斤羔羊肉
It was eight courses of lamb,

201
00:08:59,836 --> 00:09:02,346
他们还试图撮合我和他们的儿子
And they tried to fix me up with their son.

202
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:05,086
-对不起  -还没完呢
I'm sorry. not done.

203
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,516
等我终于好不容易
By the time I finally

204
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:07,916
赶到那里上班  他们已经把我的班给换了
Got to work, they'd given my shift away.

205
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:09,116
是啊  没错
Yeah, that's right.

206
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:11,416
我损失了一整天的工资  就因为这个  
I lost an entire day's pay thanks to this.

207
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,286
-这个...  -时间机器
This... time machine.

208
00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:18,716
灯会一闪一闪  托盘还会转  你想不想试试?
The lights flash and the dish spins. you want to try it?

209
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,086
才不!
No!

210
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:21,986
我才不想试试!
I don't want to try it!

211
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:24,646
天哪  你们都已经是成年人了!
My god, you are grown men!

212
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:26,386
你们怎么能浪费生命
How can you waste your lives with these

213
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:28,216
整天弄这些蠢玩具和傻戏服
Stupid toys and costumes

214
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:30,216
还有漫画书还有...那个?!
And comic books and... and now that?!

215
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,016
-那个...  -再次提醒  时间机器
That... again. time machine.

216
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,016
拜托  那才不是什么时间机器
Oh, please, it's not a time machine.

217
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:38,216
这顶多就是看上去像艾尔顿・约翰
If anything, it looks like something

218
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:40,646
驶过大沼泽地的代步工具
Elton john would drive through the everglades.

219
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:48,446
这个只能在时间上移动
It only moves in time.

220
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,846
这个在沼泽地里会比无用更无用
It would be worse than useless in a swamp.

221
00:09:56,536 --> 00:09:58,446
可悲!  你们这群人!
Pathetic! all of you!

222
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,516
可悲到了极点!
Completely pathetic!

223
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:06,886
该我了
My turn.

224
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:26,844
莱纳德  现在可是凌晨2点
Leonard, it's 2:00 in the morning.

225
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:29,384
怎么了
So?

226
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:30,744
该我了
So it's my turn.

227
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,884
你为什么把时间设在前天?
Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?

228
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,884
因为我想回到那天
Because I want to go back and keep myself

229
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:40,414
阻止自己买时间机器
From getting a time machine.

230
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:42,214
这做不到  如果你想在过去
You can't. if you were to prevent yourself

231
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,444
阻止自己买时间机器
From buying it in the past,

232
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:45,314
你就不可能现在拥有一台时间机器
You would not have it available in the present

233
00:10:45,534 --> 00:10:46,544
然后利用它回到过去
To travel back and stop yourself

234
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:48,714
阻止自己买它  所以你仍然会拥有它
From buying it. ergo, you would still have it.

235
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:50,944
这是典型的时间旅行低级错误
This is a classic rookie time-travel mistake.

236
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:57,684
我可以回到过去让你闭嘴吗?
Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?

237
00:10:57,894 --> 00:10:59,214
同样的低级错误
Same paradox.

238
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:00,844
如果你想回到过去
If you were to travel back in time

239
00:11:01,064 --> 00:11:02,244
比如说  把我打晕
And, say, knock me unconscious,

240
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:03,714
那就不会有现在的对话
You would not then have the conversation

241
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:05,184
来把你激怒  让你想回到过去
That irritated you, motivating you

242
00:11:05,394 --> 00:11:07,514
并且把我打晕
To go back and knock me unconscious.

243
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:11,244
如果我现在想把你打晕呢?
What if I knocked you unconscious right now?

244
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:13,914
那也改变不了过去
It won't change the past.

245
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:18,714
不过会让我现在好受很多
But it'd make the present so much nicer.

246
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:22,214
你有什么事心烦吗
Are you upset about something?

247
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:24,244
你从哪看出来的
What was your first clue?

248
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:26,884
有很多地方
Well, it was a number of things.

249
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:28,214
首先  你睡得很晚  
First, the late hour.

250
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:29,544
其次  你的言行似乎没有活力
Then your demeanor seems very low-energy,

251
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:30,344
再加上你很易怒
Plus your irritability.

252
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:31,344
是的  我很心烦!
Yes, I'm upset!

253
00:11:32,894 --> 00:11:35,344
我一般可不大了解这些的
I don't usually pick up on those things.

254
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:36,574
我不赖啊
Good for me.

255
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:40,944
是啊  你不赖
Yeah, good for you.

256
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:43,204
等等
Oh, wait.

257
00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:47,404
你想聊聊为什么事心烦吗?
Did you want to talk about what's bothering you?

258
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:49,674
不知道  可以吧
I don't know. maybe.

259
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:51,474
哇  我今晚真是太强了
Wow. I'm on fire tonight.

260
00:11:56,294 --> 00:11:58,274
...是这样
Uh... here's the thing.

261
00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:02,774
像佩妮这样的女孩是不会和玩时间机器的人在一起的
Girls like penny never end up with guys who own time machines.

262
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:04,644
我不同意
I disagree.

263
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:06,974
你追求佩妮失败的经历
Your inability to successfully woo penny

264
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:10,274
是要远远早于得到时间机器的日期的
Long predates your acquisition of the time machine.

265
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:14,944
这个失败是显而易见的
That failure clearly stands on its own.

266
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:17,144
多谢指出
Thanks for pointing it out.

267
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:19,174
此外  你的前提是有瑕疵的
In addition, your premise is flawed.

268
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:22,104
在原版电影中  罗德・泰勒就是用时间机器
In the original film, rod taylor got yvette mimieux

269
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,704
得到了伊薇特・米米亚克斯(电影女主角)
With that very time machine.

270
00:12:23,924 --> 00:12:26,504
回到未来  马帝・麦克佛莱得到了机会
In back to the future, marty mcfly got the opportunity

271
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:29,044
和他魅力十足的年轻妈妈鬼混
To hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.

272
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:32,974
那些都是电影
Those are movies.

273
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:34,474
当然都是电影
Of course they're movies.

274
00:12:34,694 --> 00:12:36,544
你难道指望我举出个现实版
Were you expecting me to come up with an example

275
00:12:36,754 --> 00:12:39,404
时间机器的例子吗?
Involving a real-life time machine?

276
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:42,174
荒谬
That's absurd.

277
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,004
加油啊  伙计们  用力推!
Come on, guys, push!

278
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,704
如果我再用力
If I push any harder,

279
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:49,674
就快把结肠给"分娩"出来了
I'm going to give birth to my colon.

280
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,274
好  各位
Oh, hey, guys.

281
00:12:52,494 --> 00:12:53,274
你好  佩妮
Oh. hi, penny.

282
00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:58,604
休息一会吧
Take a break, guys!

283
00:12:58,824 --> 00:13:00,304
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

284
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:04,144
你知道  就是搬搬时间机器
Oh, you know, just moving a time machine.

285
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:06,974
好的  不错  但我要赶去工作了  所以...
Yeah. okay, neat, but I really gotta get to work, so...

286
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:08,704
没问题
No problem.

287
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,004
坚持一下
Hang on.

288
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:19,644
但是...你的时间机器怎么办
But... what about your time machine?

289
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:22,044
有些事情比玩具更重要
Some things are more important than toys.

290
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:32,504
我好害怕
I'm scared.

291
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:35,174
不要害怕  宝贝  有我在
Don't worry, baby. I've got you.

292
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:36,374
哦  莱纳德
Oh, leonard.

293
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:58,544
仍旧该我了
It's still my turn.

294
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,015
你干什么
What are you doing?

295
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:08,385
把我收集的所有东西打包
I'm packing up all my collectibles

296
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:10,785
然后带下去卖给漫画书店
And taking them down to the comic book store to sell.

297
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:13,185
真的有必要吗
Was that really necessary?

298
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,315
如果需要钱  你随时可以卖血啊
If you need money, you can always sell blood.

299
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:19,515
还有精液
And semen.

300
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,485
这和钱无关
This is not about money.

301
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,645
我们带了吃的
We brought food!

302
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:26,845
熏鲑鱼和硬面包圈  时间旅人的早餐
Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time-travelers.

303
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:28,115
棒极了
Terrific.

304
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,685
有人想要买我时间机器里的股份吗
Does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?

305
00:14:29,895 --> 00:14:30,415
怎么
Why?

306
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:31,815
我不想再要了
I don't want it anymore.

307
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:32,815
为什么
Why?

308
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:34,415
...私人原因
Just... personal reasons.

309
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:36,355
我蜘蛛侠一般的嗅觉告诉我
My spidey sense tells me

310
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:37,615
这和佩妮有关
This has something to do with penny.

311
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,015
听着
Look,

312
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:41,315
-你们到底想不想要买股份?  -我给你
Do you want to buy me out or not? I'll give you

313
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:42,945
100美元  这样我就是半个拥有者了
A hundred dollars, which will make me half-owner

314
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:44,245
然后我们把它放到我的阳台上去
And we'll put it on my balcony.

315
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:45,545
去你的阳台
Screw his balcony.

316
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:47,345
我给你120美元  我要放到我的车库
I'll give you $120 and we'll put it in my garage.

317
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:49,345
我的股份当时是200美金
I paid $200 for my share.

318
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:50,585
小子  大家都知道
Dude, everybody knows

319
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:52,015
时间机器会因为转让
A time machine loses half its value

320
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:53,515
而贬低一半的价值
The minute you drive it off the lot.

321
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:55,685
我付200
I'll go for $200.

322
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,315
让时间机器就呆在原地
That time machine stays right where it is.

323
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,885
我付300
$300 and I'll throw in

324
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:01,385
我要打造最初的1973年的星战飞船
My original 1979 mattel millennium falcon

325
00:15:01,595 --> 00:15:03,115
并使之兼具真正的光速和声效
With real light speed sound effects.

326
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,745
不  不再要玩具和动作模型了
No. no more toys or action figures

327
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:10,245
也不要道具  复制品  戏服还有机器人
Or props or replicas or costumes or robots

328
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:11,885
也不要达斯・维德的变声工具了
Or darth vader voice changers.

329
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:13,615
我不想再要所有这些了
I'm getting rid of all of it.

330
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:14,785
你不能这么做
You can't do that.

331
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:16,115
看看你收集的这些吧
Look what you've created here.

332
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:18,415
这就像是封闭的电脑狂人
It's like nerdvana.

333
00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:22,385
更重要的是
More importantly,

334
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:24,315
你有达斯・维德的变声工具?
You have a darth vader voice changer?

335
00:15:24,535 --> 00:15:26,845
不会再有了
Not for long.

336
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:29,015
我有权要求那"Golden Age Flash"(一部漫画)
Oh, I call dibs on the golden age flash.

337
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:30,245
等等  我要靠它来
Hang on. I need that

338
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:31,915
集全"正义联盟"(一部漫画)
To complete my justice society of america collection.

339
00:15:32,135 --> 00:15:33,085
太遗憾了  我有权要求了
Too bad. I called dibs.

340
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:34,445
-你不能这么有权要求的  -我既可以也叫了
You can't just call dibs. I can and I did.

341
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:35,785
去维基百科查查"有权要求"吧
Look up "dibs" in wikipedia.

342
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,385
在竞价战中是没有有权要求的
Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.

343
00:15:39,595 --> 00:15:41,045
这不是竞价战
It's not a bidding war.

344
00:15:41,265 --> 00:15:43,645
我全部要卖给楼下漫画书店的拉里
I'm selling it all to larry down at the comic book store.

345
00:15:43,865 --> 00:15:44,885
为什么是拉里  拉力有权要求了?
Why larry? did larry call dibs?

346
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,345
你能不能别提有权要求了?!
Will you forget dibs?!

347
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:47,685
就这整套东西
He offered me a fair price

348
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:48,845
他提了个合理的价钱
For the whole collection.

349
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:50,415
多少?  我给同样价钱
What's the number? I'll match it.

350
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:53,185
我给同样价钱再加一千卢比
I'll match it plus a thousand rupees.

351
00:15:53,395 --> 00:15:55,015
-汇率是多少  -不关你事
What's the exchange rate? none of your business.

352
00:15:55,235 --> 00:15:57,045
成还不成?
Take it or leave it?

353
00:15:57,265 --> 00:15:58,385
妈妈  我的成年礼债券在吗
Mom? my bar mitzvah bonds.

354
00:15:58,595 --> 00:15:59,715
我有多少?
How much do I got?

355
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:00,815
谢谢
Thanks.

356
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:03,915
我可以出价2600美金加上以色列的两颗树
I can go $2,600 and two trees in israel.

357
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:06,415
算了  伙计们
Forget it, guys.

358
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:07,685
如果我卖给了你们其中一个
If I sell to one of you,

359
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:09,385
另外两个会对我大光其火的
The other two are going to be really mad at me.

360
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:10,415
管他呢
Who cares?

361
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:12,585
只要你卖给我
As long as you pick me!

362
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:14,245
好了  莱纳德  把盒子放下
Okay, leonard, put down the box.

363
00:16:14,465 --> 00:16:15,885
-我们谈谈  -抱歉  拉杰
Let's talk. sorry, raj.

364
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:17,215
我已经决定了
My mind is made up.

365
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,545
不!
No!

366
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:20,585
我一定得阻止你
I can't let you do this.

367
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:22,645
谢尔顿  你让开
Sheldon, get out of my way.

368
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:28,285
没人可以过去!
None shall pass!

369
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:32,745
好吧
Okay.

370
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:35,145
我不想这样的
I did not want to do this, but

371
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:38,645
可我手上拿的是完好无损的
I have here the rare mint condition production error

372
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,815

373
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:43,645
乔迪拉弗吉的珍贵原版纪念品
Without his visor in the original packaging.

374
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:45,645
如果你们继续挡我的路
If you do not get out of my way,

375
00:16:45,865 --> 00:16:47,645
我就把它拆封了
I will open it.

376
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:51,615
好  伙计  冷静
Okay, man. be cool.

377
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:53,885
我们是自己人
We're all friends here.

378
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:56,745
你们在搞什么
What the hell's going on?

379
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:58,445
你个伪善者!
You hypocrite!

380
00:16:58,665 --> 00:16:59,745
什么?
What?

381
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,245
"长大了不能玩玩具"小姐
Little miss "grown-ups don't play with toys."

382
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:04,315
如果我现在进你那间屋子
If I were to go into that apartment right now,

383
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:05,945
我会找不到豆豆娃?
Would I not find beanie babies?

384
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:07,345
难道你不收集
Are you not an accumulator

385
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:09,015
小熊公仔和维尼?
Of care bears and my little ponies?

386
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:12,085
看看在你热裤上嬉戏的日本小猫又是什么
And who is that japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts?

387
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:14,145
你好  Hello Kitty!
Hello, hello kitty!

388
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:18,245
好
Okay.

389
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:21,445
好  听着  如果是因为昨天的事  莱纳德
Okay, look, if this is about yesterday, leonard,

390
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,715
我为我昨天的话感到抱歉
I am really sorry about what I said.

391
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:23,745
我只是有点心烦而已
I was just upset.

392
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:24,985
不  还是很中听的
No, I needed to hear it.

393
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:26,945
不  不是的  真的  你是个很好的人
No, you didn't. look, you are a great guy

394
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:29,985
而这是你喜欢的东西  这才是你的本色
And it is the things you love that make you who you are.

395
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:33,045
我猜这就是"我的大波"
I guess that makes me "large breasts."

396
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:37,715
但是
Still,

397
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:40,215
我还是觉得是时候跟这些东西说再见了
I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff

398
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,015
然后  开始新的生活
And, you know, move on with my life.

399
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:44,015
真的?
Really?

400
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:45,845
是的
Yeah.

401
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:48,915
不错
Well, good for you.

402
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,945
谢谢
Thanks.

403
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:53,945
你想不想...
Hey, do you want to...

404
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:55,215
也许过一会...
I don't know, later...

405
00:17:55,435 --> 00:17:56,815
不好意思
Excuse me.

406
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,815
-佩妮  -麦克
Hey, penny. hi, mike.

407
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:00,615
-可以走了吗  -可以  等我换换衣服
You ready to go? oh, yeah. I just have to change.

408
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:01,645
我来帮你一把
I'll give you a hand.

409
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:03,485
别闹了
