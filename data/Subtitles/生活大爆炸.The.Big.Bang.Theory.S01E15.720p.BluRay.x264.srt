1
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:04,751
另一方面呢  物理学家又开始担心
On the other hand, some physicists are concerned

2
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:06,701
一旦超撞机真的实现
That if this supercollider actually works,

3
00:00:06,701 --> 00:00:08,801
它产生的黑洞会吞噬地球
It'll create a black hole and swallow up the earth,

4
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:10,421
终结生命
Ending life as we know it.

5
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:12,561
真是一群爱哭鬼
Pfft, what a bunch of crybabies.

6
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:14,451
人有多大胆  地有多大产
No guts, no glory, man.

7
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:17,301
嘿  看看这个
Hey, check it out.

8
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:20,541
药学院要招志愿者
The school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.

9
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:24,411
"我们正在测试一种新药  专治社交焦虑症
"we are testing a new medication "for social anxiety, panic attacks,

10
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:27,251
恐慌发作症  陌生环境恐怖症和强迫症"
Agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder."

11
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,941
他们为什么要在这招人?
Why would they be looking for test subjects here?

12
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:33,721
我怎么知道  拉杰
I don't know, raj.

13
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:36,571
没准是因为漫画书店没有布告栏
Maybe the comic book store doesn't have a bulletin board.

14
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:41,001
在这干什么呢?
What's going on?

15
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:43,191
嘘  嘘  谢尔顿办公室有个靓妹
Shh, shh, hot girl in sheldon's office.

16
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,251
在谢尔顿的办公室?
Sheldon's office?

17
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:48,381
她是不是走丢了?
Is she lost?

18
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:50,711
我认为不是
I don't think so.

19
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:52,611
我从停车场就开始跟着她了
I followed her here from the parking lot.

20
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:56,431
可能她是他的律师
Maybe she's his lawyer.

21
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:58,921
那她可以随时查看我的诉讼
Well, she's free to examine my briefs.

22
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,631
-霍华德  -我知道  我很恶心
Howard. I know, I'm disgusting.

23
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:02,531
我应该被惩罚...被她惩罚
I should be punished... by her.

24
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:04,151
看  我还是这么恶心
Oh, look, I did it again.

25
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,211
那样就差不多了
That should do it.

26
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:08,011
麻烦你跑一趟
Thank you for coming by.

27
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:15,571
你们好啊
Hello.

28
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:18,611
嘿  老弟...
Oh, hey, buddy...

29
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:22,221
"老弟..."?
"buddy..."?

30
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,131
不好意思  我来迟了
Sorry I'm late.

31
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:27,981
我正在攻关一个项目  可能要上一次航天飞机了
I'm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.

32
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:30,031
为什么要说晚了呢?
How can you be late?

33
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:31,691
我根本没想要你来
I wasn't expecting you at all.

34
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,121
我总是神出鬼没
Nobody ever expects me.

35
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:35,481
有时你只是看着看着就...
Sometimes you just look and...

36
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,731
霍华德・沃尔维茨驾到
Bam! howard wolowitz.

37
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:40,561
谢尔顿  能介绍一下吗?
Sheldon, are you gonna introduce us?

38
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:42,821
可以  这是米茜
Oh, all right. uh, this is missy.

39
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:46,691
米茜  这是莱纳德和拉杰  你已经见过霍华德了
Missy, this is leonard and rajesh, and you've already met howard.

40
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:47,711
很高兴见到你们
It's nice to meet you.

41
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:49,141
你也是  也  也是
You, too, as well, also.

42
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:50,301
是
Yeah.

43
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:54,401
你们两个是怎么认识的?
So, how do you two know each other?

44
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:58,051
他的头可在我的胯下呆过9个月
Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head.

45
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,121
啊?
Excuse me?

46
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,321
她是我的孪生妹妹
She's my twin sister.

47
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:08,591
她以为自己很风趣  但说实话  我从来看不出
She thinks she's funny, but frankly, I've never been able to see it.

48
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:11,661
这是因为你根本无法衡量什么是幽默  谢利(昵称)
That's because you have no measurable sense of humor, shelly.

49
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:14,271
一个人要怎么衡量幽默?
How exactly would one measure a sense of humor?

50
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:16,391
幽默测量器?
A humormometer?

51
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:21,321
我觉得你非常得幽默
Well, I think you're delightfully droll.

52
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:26,321
-当然  就像法语中  "你真有趣"  -看我记不记得住
Ooor, as the french say, tres drole. okay, so let me see if I got this.

53
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:29,231
莱纳德  霍华德  还有...
Leonard, howard and...

54
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,941
不好意思  你叫?
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

55
00:02:58,031 --> 00:02:59,261
拉杰
Rajesh.

56
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:23,001
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第15集
The.Shiksa.Indeterminacy

57
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:26,984
那么  米茜  你为什么从德州跑到这来?
So, missy, what brings you all the way from texas?

58
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:29,304
是不是缘分?  我觉得是缘分
Was it perhaps destiny? I think it was destiny.

59
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:32,044
我朋友明晚在迪斯尼结婚
My friend's s getting married at disneyland tomorrow night.

60
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:35,124
destiny "缘分、命运"也作"目的地"解 阿纳海姆是迪斯尼乐园的所在地

61
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:35,124
缘分  名字就叫做阿纳海姆市(美国南加州)
Destiny, thy name is anaheim.

62
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:40,264
我还过来让谢利在父亲的地产文书上签个字
And I had to drop off some papers for shelly to sign for my dad's estate.

63
00:03:40,264 --> 00:03:41,824
文书可以邮寄的吧
The papers could've been mailed.

64
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:44,264
妈让你来监视我  没错吧
Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn't she?

65
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:46,504
我想这就是为什么他们要管你叫天才了
I guess that's why they call you a genius.

66
00:03:46,504 --> 00:03:49,074
他们叫我天才是因为我确实是天才
They call me a genius because I'm a genius.

67
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:52,604
告诉妈我目前165磅
Tell mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds

68
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:55,264
还有我的胃肠蠕动正常
And that I'm having regular bowel movements.

69
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:58,184
好好享受婚礼  拜拜
Enjoy the wedding. good-bye.

70
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:04,304
婚礼不是明天吗  不如你今晚来我们这吧?
If the wedding's not until tomorrow, why don't you stay with us tonight?

71
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:05,864
我看行不通
Oh, I don't think so.

72
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:07,524
谢利不喜欢别人缠着他
Shelly doesn't like company.

73
00:04:07,524 --> 00:04:08,454
即使是在他小时候
Even as a little boy,

74
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:11,314
他也会在晚上把假想的朋友送回家
He'd send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.

75
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:13,104
他们不是朋友
They were not friends.

76
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:15,144
他们是假想的同事
They were imaginary colleagues.

77
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:16,994
你看  你都来了
Look, you're here.

78
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:18,354
我们有很多房间的
We have plenty of room.

79
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:19,264
不  我们没有
No, we don't.

80
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:22,294
别这样  谢利  她是家人啊
Come on, shelly. she's family.

81
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:25,214
那又怎么样  我都没有邀请你妈来
So what, I don't issue invitations to your mother.

82
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:29,094
能不用在高峰时段开去阿纳海姆也不错啊
Well, it would be nice not to have to drive to anaheim in rush hour.

83
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:30,874
再也不要叫我谢利
And don't ever call me shelly.

84
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,654
就这么定了  你住我们这儿
So it's settled. You'll stay with us.

85
00:04:33,654 --> 00:04:34,734
我带你去拿车
Yeah, I'll walk you to your car.

86
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,844
你车停在3区  c层  没错吧
You're in structure 3, level c, right?

87
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,664
这都是怎么一回事?
What just happened?

88
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:45,404
反正
So anyway,

89
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:47,934
我们8岁时  谢尔顿把我的
We're eight years old and sheldon converts my

90
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:51,614
傻瓜式烤箱改装成了一种高能量熔炉
Easy bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace.

91
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:53,594
太经典了
Just classic.

92
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:56,284
我要做家用集成电路
I needed a place to fire ceramic

93
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:59,294
需要一个可以融化半导体陶瓷基底的地方
Semiconductor substrates for homemade integrated circuits.

94
00:04:59,804 --> 00:05:01,454
他当时想要造一个
He was trying to build some sort of

95
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:03,344
武装机器人来把我赶出他的房间
Armed robot to keep me out of his room.

96
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,854
要不是你一直闯进我的房间这也没必要
Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.

97
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:09,794
还有  我去做了些小的玉米蛋糕
Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you.

98
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:10,804
突然哗的一下
There's a big flash.

99
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:13,254
你醒来的时候眉毛就不见了
Next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.

100
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:16,794
你的眉毛?
Not your eyebrows.

101
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:17,654
是
Yep,

102
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:19,674
然后我整个二年级都要
I had to go through the entire second

103
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:22,084
顶着妈妈画的弯曲的假眉毛去上学
Grade with crooked eyebrows my mom drew on.

104
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:24,234
是这样吗?
Is that what that was?

105
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:25,944
我还以为是二年级的课程
I just assumed that the second grade

106
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:27,814
让你行为变得有些古怪
Curriculum had rendered you quizzical.

107
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:34,244
莱纳德  你短裤忘在楼下的干衣机里了
Hey, leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.

108
00:05:40,614 --> 00:05:41,974
那不是我的
Those are not mine.

109
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:44,204
真的吗
Really?

110
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:46,724
这里面有你名字的小标签啊
They have your little name label in them.

111
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,594
对...不  我...
Yeah... no, I do... i...

112
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:54,644
我是用这来磨光我捕鱼用的鱼叉器材的
I use those, uh, just to polish up my spearfishing equipment.

113
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:57,544
我用鱼叉捕鱼的
I spearfish.

114
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:04,414
我不去用石弓打猎时  我会去用鱼叉捕鱼
When I'm not crossbow hunting, I spearfish.

115
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:09,104
佩妮  这是谢尔顿的孪生妹妹  米茜
Uh, penny, this is sheldon's twin sister, missy.

Missy, this is our neighbor penny. don't look that much alike.

117
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:14,314
让我说声哈利路亚(赞美上帝)
Can I get a hallelujah?

118
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:17,974
异卵双生的双胞胎来自于两个不同的卵子中
Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs.

119
00:06:17,974 --> 00:06:20,034
他们不像一般的同胞手足那样
They are no more alike than any other siblings.

120
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:21,574
哈利路亚!

Yes, I'm very hopeful. hello, missy.

126

他们提到过可能会有副作用
They mentioned there may be side effects.

00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:53,754
米茜  你遇到过来自充满异域风情的印度次大陆的男人吗
So, missy, have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of india?

我有一台哈雷摩托(俚语指小弟弟)
'cause I ride a hog.

132
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:03,934
哈雷?
A hog?

You still have to wear a helmet.

135
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:14,244
你听说过伽摩经吗
Have you ever heard of the kama sutra?

136
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:15,114
讲性爱的书
The sex book.

137
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:16,884
是印度的性爱之书
The indian sex book.

138
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:21,834
换句话说  如果你好奇是谁写了这本关于爱的书
In other words, if you "wonder, wonder who wrote the book of love,

139
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:22,754
是我们印度人
" it was us.

140
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:26,184
谢尔顿的妹妹挺漂亮啊  是吧
So, sheldon's sister is pretty cute, huh?

141
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:27,684
我没有盯着她看
I wasn't staring.

142
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:32,214
我没有说你在盯着她啊  我只是说她挺漂亮
I didn't say you were. I just said she was cute.

143
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:37,854
可能吧  如果你喜欢这么高...
Oh, eh... maybe, if you like women who are tall...

144
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:40,854
而且完美的
And perfect.

145
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:45,874
谢尔顿  你怎么不理你妹妹啊
Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?

146
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:49,264
我没有不理我妹妹  我是不理你们任何人
I'm not ignoring my sister. I'm ignoring all of you.

147
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:51,584
这里有些小吃
I brought snacks!

148
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:55,704
哈  腌黄瓜和..
Oh, my, gherkins and...

149
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:57,524
洋葱酱  这个是洋葱酱
Onion dip. it's onion dip.

150
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:02,164
我们不常招待人的
We don't entertain much.

151
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,204
米茜
Missy.

152
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:06,714
你喜欢穿睡衣吗
Do you enjoy pajamas?

153
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:08,394
应该是吧
I guess.

154
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:10,194
太好了  是我们印度人发明的睡衣
Yeah, we indians invented them.

155
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:12,494
不客气
You're welcome.

156
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:16,814
那这么说  是我们犹太人发明了割礼
Yeah, well, my people invented circumcision.

157
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,284
不客气
You're welcome.

158
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,904
米茜  我要去做指甲
Missy, I'm gonna go get my nails done.

159
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:27,784
想一起去吗
Do you want to come?

160
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:30,224
太好了  我去  谢谢你
God, yes. thanks.

161
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:31,454
不客气
You're welcome.

162
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:34,354
-大伙再见  -再见  米茜
Bye, guys. bye, missy.

163
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:36,584
-米茜  再见  -再见  莱纳德
Bye, missy, see you. good-bye, leonard.

164
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,634
对...不...再见  佩妮
Oh, yeah, no, uh, bye, penny.

165
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:42,084
听着  你们俩给我闪开
Okay, you two have to back off.

166
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:43,604
我干吗要闪开  你闪开  伙计
Why should I back off? you back off, dude.

167
00:08:43,604 --> 00:08:46,674
不好意思  这是我的房子  她是我室友的妹妹
Excuse me, this is my apartment, and she's my roommate's sister.

168
00:08:46,674 --> 00:08:48,184
那又怎么样  你已经有佩妮了
So what? you've already got penny!

169
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:49,484
我怎么有佩妮了?
How do I have penny?

170
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:51,874
我到底哪门子有佩妮了?
In what universe do I have penny?

171
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:53,564
那我可以追她了?
So I can have penny?

172
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:55,284
该死  不行!
Hell, no!

173
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:58,704
抱歉  我能插两句吗
Excuse me. can I interject something?

174
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:01,754
我正在线订一个披萨
I'm ordering pizza online.

175
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:03,614
意大利辣香肠你们都吃吧?
Is everyone okay with pepperoni?

176
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,354
谢尔顿  我能跟你单独谈一下吗
Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?

177
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:08,724
行啊
I guess.

178
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:11,574
别担心  我会点那种芝士少一点的
Don't worry. I was going to order you cheese-less.

179
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:12,804
-谢谢你  -没事
Thank you. it's okay.

180
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:15,474
不能吃乳糖不是什么丢脸的事
Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.

181
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:19,144
我是梦幻印度情人
I'm a fancy indian man.

182
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:20,624
我们发明了睡衣
We invented pajamas.

183
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,894
看我  我没有包皮
Hey, look at me. I don't have a foreskin.

184
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,644
谢尔顿...
Sheldon...

185
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:38,864
你难道没意识到你妹妹魅不可挡吗
Are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?

186
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:43,074
她确实有着西方文化所青睐的
She certainly has the symmetry and low

187
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:45,344
既匀称而又低脂肪的身段
Body fat that western culture deems desirable.

188
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,054
这倒是值得注意的  在历史上
It's noteworthy, at other points in history,

189
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,944
胖一些的女人象征着美丽
Heavier women were the standard for

190
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:52,544
因为她们的腰身意味着富饶
Beauty because their girth suggested affluence.

191
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:54,824
很令人着迷  但...
That's fascinating, but...

192
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:57,164
我没有说令人着迷  我只是说值得注意
I didn't say it was fascinating. I said it was noteworthy.

193
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:00,414
好吧  我注意到了
All right... noted.

194
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,534
我的意思是  库萨帕里和沃尔维茨
But my point is that koothrappali and wolowitz,

195
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:06,984
他们在泡你的妹妹啊
They're hitting on your sister.

196
00:10:06,984 --> 00:10:08,464
这简直...
Oh, it's...

197
00:10:09,614 --> 00:10:11,944
没事啊
Oh, okay.

198
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:14,674
我不想评价你说话的修辞手法
You know, I don't want to criticize your rhetorical style,

199
00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:16,494
但要是你能开门见山地说
But we'd be a lot further along in this

200
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:18,684
我们可能已经谈得很深了
Conversation if you'd begun with that thought.

201
00:10:19,254 --> 00:10:20,044
-很好  -但是...
That's great, but my...

202
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:22,254
我要说的是  我们拐了个不必要的弯
What I'm saying is that we took quite an Unnecessary detour

203
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,924
因为现在我发现这才是你的论点
from what I now understand to be your thesis.

204
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,054
又怎么了
Whatever.

205
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:28,674
你不能干坐着啊
You have to do something about it.

206
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:29,764
为什么
Why?

207
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:31,524
因为她是你妹妹
Because she's your sister.

208
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:33,914
我不明白
I don't understand.

209
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:36,474
不错  我们共同在一个子宫里待过九个月
Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months,

210
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:39,714
但此后我们就你走阳关道我走独木桥了
But since then we've pretty much gone our own separate ways.

211
00:10:40,924 --> 00:10:44,014
好吧  那这么想吧...
Okay, uh, consider this...

212
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:45,514
你父亲去世之后
With your father gone,

213
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:50,964
确保米茜能选择一位合适的伴侣就是你的责任了
It is your responsibility to make sure that missy chooses a suitable mate.

214
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:54,314
我倒没想过这个
I hadn't considered that.

215
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,144
我们确实有相同的DNA
We do share dna. uh-huh.

216
00:10:57,144 --> 00:10:59,604
所以有这种可能  尽管可能性不大
So there is the possibility, however remote,

217
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:02,064
她的天赋可以创造另一个
That resting in her loins is the potential

218
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:04,874
像我这样不平凡的人
For another individual as remarkable as myself.

219
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:07,524
正是
Exactly.

220
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:11,054
并且你有责任替你自己和你子孙保留
And you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect

221
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:14,734
你妹妹所传后代遗传基因的完整性
The genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring.

222
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,474
你说的对
You're right.

223
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:20,764
如果有人想接近米茜的输卵管
If someone wants to get at missy's fallopian tubes,

224
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,244
他们必须通过我
They'll have to go through me.

225
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:34,234
我是毁灭之神湿婆(印度三大神中司破坏之神)
I am shiva the destroyer!

226
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:36,084
我会赢得这个女人
I will have the woman.

227
00:11:37,284 --> 00:11:41,094
警告你  我可是数学夏令营的柔道冠军
I'm warning you I was judo champion at math camp.

228
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:43,614
好了  你们幼稚够了吧
All right, now that's enough juvenile squabbling.

229
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:44,554
给我停下
You stop it.

230
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:46,314
我说给我停下!
Stop it, I say!

231
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,874
我现在就来处理这件事
I'm going to settle this right now.

232
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:52,044
你们中的任何一个都配不上我妹妹
Neither of you are good enough for my sister.

233
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:53,584
你是谁  凭什么你决定?
Who are you to decide that?

234
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:55,264
他是这个家的男人
He's the man of his family.

235
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:56,734
你们必须尊重他的意愿
You have to respect his wishes.

236
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:58,944
-顺便说一句  你也出局了  -你说什么?
You're out, too, by the way. say what?

237
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:00,294
我不是针对你
It's nothing personal.

238
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:02,304
我只是更希望我将来的侄子或者侄女
I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew

239
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,014
不要成为每次一吃冰激淋就觉得胀气的人
Didn't become flatulent every time they ate an eskimo pie.

240
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:13,754
你高兴个什么劲儿
What are you so happy about?

241
00:12:13,754 --> 00:12:14,934
我不是高兴
I'm not happy.

242
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,324
药起作用了  我停不下来
It's the medication. I can't stop smiling.

243
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:28,242
莱纳德让我意识到遗传基因的赌注有多大
That leonard's made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are,

244
00:12:28,242 --> 00:12:29,942
我们必须面对现实
We have to face the fact that none

245
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:32,002
你们没有一个配得上我妹妹
Of you are suitable mates for my sister.

246
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:32,842
等一下
Wait a minute.

247
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:35,012
是莱纳德让你意识到的?
Leonard made you aware of that?

248
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,322
我们都会犯错  换个话题吧
We all make mistakes. let's move on.

249
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:42,052
插一句  不过我认为你错失了一个良机
Excuse me, but I think you're missing a big opportunity here.

250
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:42,942
怎么说
How so?

251
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:46,522
每个人都知道基因多样化能创造出了不起的后代
Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring.

252
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:49,862
"摩卡"产于阿拉伯 "拿铁"谐音拉丁

253
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:49,862
不如考虑在拿铁家族里 放点摩卡调和一下
Why not put a little mocha in the family latte?

254
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,462
理论上  你说的没错
In principle, you have a point.

255
00:12:54,462 --> 00:12:55,732
但考虑到实际情况
But as a practical matter,

256
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:58,022
允许我提醒你一下  你都需要实验性药品
Need I remind you that it takes experimental

257
00:12:58,022 --> 00:13:01,502
才能让你更容易开口跟异性说话
Pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.

258
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:05,182
我觉得你把太多的焦点放在药物上了
I think you're focusing entirely too much on the drugs.

259
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:12,752
是不是因为我是个犹太人?
Is it 'cause I'm jewish?

260
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:15,952
要知道为了和你妹妹在一起  我愿意用猪排杀了我的导师
'cause I'd kill my rabbi with a pork chop to be with your sister.

261
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:24,882
这和你的宗教信仰无关
This has nothing to do with religion.

262
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:27,132
只是因为你还是个小男孩
This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny,

263
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:29,192
一个仍和妈妈一起住的小男孩
Tiny man who still lives with his mother.

264
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:32,512
谢尔顿  你真不讲道理
Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.

265
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,112
是吗
Am I?

266
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:38,032
来  吃了这片芝士能不放屁  你就可以和我妹上床
Here, eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.

267
00:13:39,462 --> 00:13:40,982
噢  真的吗
Oh, really?

268
00:13:45,182 --> 00:13:46,432
靠
Oops.

269
00:13:47,812 --> 00:13:49,872
谢利  我可以和你说几句吗
Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute?

270
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:51,202
私下里
Alone.

271
00:13:51,972 --> 00:13:54,422
为什么大家突然都想和我单独谈话
Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone?

272
00:13:54,422 --> 00:13:56,802
通常没有人喜欢和我单独相处的呀
Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.

273
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,952
我们都会犯错  换一个话题吧
We all make mistakes. let's move on.

274
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:12,202
好吧  我不想过问你为何为了区区芝士把我推销出去
Okay, I'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese.

275
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,782
不过你何时开始关心我和谁上床了?
But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?

276
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:19,212
说实话  我从来没有考虑过
Well, truthfully, I've never given it any thought,

277
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:22,902
不过我后来意识到  你身上带着潜在的DNA
But it has been pointed out to me that you carry dna of great potential.

278
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:24,362
你在说些什么鬼话
What on earth are you talking about?

279
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:25,412
让我解释一下
Let me explain.

280
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:28,802
你知道的  我是个优秀的遗传变异产物
You see, I'm a superior genetic mutation, uh,

281
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:32,502
对现有的次品来说存在一个显著提高
An improvement on the existing mediocre stock.

282
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,802
你说的"次品"是什么意思?
And what do you mean, "mediocre stock"?

283
00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:38,132
就是指你
That would be you.

284
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:42,792
不过在你身体里  有一个潜在的我
But residing within you, is the potential for another me.

285
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:47,992
一个可能更高  更聪明  雀斑更少的  谢尔顿2.0
Perhaps even taller, smarter, and less prone to freckling, a sheldon 2.0,

286
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:49,192
可以这么称呼
if you will.

287
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:51,902
"谢尔顿2.0"?
"sheldon 2.0"?

288
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:52,352
正是
Exactly.

289
00:14:52,352 --> 00:14:52,552
现在
Now,

290
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:57,382
我不是说我要专横地决定你要和谁在一起
I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with.

291
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:58,822
如果你不被追求者吸引
If you're not attracted to the suitor,

292
00:14:58,822 --> 00:15:00,852
那怀孕的可能性就会减少
Then the likelihood of conception will be reduced.

293
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:02,622
你开什么玩笑
You have got to be kidding me.

294
00:15:02,622 --> 00:15:03,152
完全没有
Not at all.

295
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,702
频繁性交会大大增加受精几率
Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertilization.

296
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:10,392
好了  谢利  坐下
Okay, shelly, sit down.

297
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:17,152
我花了一辈子时间去消化这一事实  我的双胞胎哥哥
Now I've lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin

298
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:21,292
像妈妈所说  是个"上帝赐予的特别的小孩"
Brother is, as mom puts it, "one of god's special, little people."

299
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:24,442
我一直认为我更像一只布谷鸟
I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird.

300
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:24,872
你知道的
You know,

301
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:28,772
一种把蛋放在普通鸟巢里的了不起的生物
A superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds.

302
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:31,192
当然  先孵化出的布谷鸟会吃掉所有的食物
Of course, the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food,

303
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:33,472
留下其他普通的兄弟姐妹们饿死
Leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death.

304
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:36,982
你很幸运  这就是我使用这比喻想要说的
Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.

305
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:40,902
我还以为你是想说"布谷"
I thought it ended at "cuckoo."

306
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:44,962
你听好
You listen to me.

307
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:47,892
如果你想做一个关心妹妹的好哥哥
If you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me,

308
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:48,622
那太好了
Then terrific.

309
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:50,252
尽管来做
Bring it on.

310
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:52,892
但只要你有一次想告诉我该和谁上床
But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with,

311
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:54,552
我就得跟你回顾回顾
And you and I are going to go round and

312
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:56,342
我们小时候的那种方式了
Round the way we did when we were little.

313
00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:57,622
没忘吧?
Remember?

314
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:04,532
-我有另外个提议  -说
I have an alternate proposal. go on.

315
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:05,982
你捐出卵子
You donate eggs.

316
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:07,892
我们把它放去低温储藏
We will place them in cryogenic storage.

317
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:10,992
我会帮你的卵子找一个合格的精子
I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs,

318
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:13,632
等他们完成受精后再植入你的体内
Have them fertilized and implanted in you.

319
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:15,362
这样  对每个人都好
That way, everybody wins.

320
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:25,562
更正下
Correction.

321
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:27,772
米茜想跟谁约会不关我的事
Missy can date whoever she wants.

322
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:31,472
我们得想办法解决下
Look, we have to settle this.

323
00:16:31,552 --> 00:16:32,632
我同意
I agree.

324
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:34,462
谢尔顿的妹妹躲在佩妮家里
Sheldon's sister is hiding at penny's because

325
00:16:34,462 --> 00:16:36,422
是因为我们在同一时间向她发起攻击
We've all been hitting on her at the same time.

326
00:16:36,422 --> 00:16:37,762
她才没躲呢
She's not hiding.

327
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:40,952
她得留点私人空间来打电话给她生病的奶奶
She needed privacy to call her grandmother who's apparently very sick.

328
00:16:40,952 --> 00:16:42,852
我想她还得洗她的头发
Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair.

329
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:46,722
你这个傻混蛋
Oh, you poor, deluded bastard.

330
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:48,252
别跟我来劲  你这家伙
Don't start with me, dude.

331
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:49,512
你还想再来?  来啊
You want to go again? let's go.

332
00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:50,952
-坐下  -好吧
Sit down. okay.

333
00:16:52,372 --> 00:16:55,082
如果我们想争米茜  我们来好好地争
If we're going to fight over missy, let's do it the right way.

334
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,722
有尊严地争
The honorable way.

335
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:00,162
吃我一拳!
Take that!

336
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:01,552
还想再来?
You want some more?

337
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:06,602
他倒下了!
And he's down!

338
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:09,792
1  2  3
One, two, three...

339
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,602
来啊  快起来啊
Come on, come on! get up!

340
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:12,962
乖乖躺着吧  婊子
Stay down, bitch!

341
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:16,712
9  10
...nine, ten.

342
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:20,672
上帝的选择是正确的
Yeah! natural selection at work.

343
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,432
为人类感到悲哀
I weep for humanity.

344
00:17:23,082 --> 00:17:25,762
失陪  我得去告诉米茜这个好消息
Excuse me while I go tell missy the good news.

345
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:34,232
-好啊  莱纳德  -好啊  佩妮
Hey, leonard. oh, hi, penny.

346
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:34,772
还不错吧
How's it going?

347
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:37,452
对了  你约会的那个对象麦克  现在还好着吗
Listen, that guy mike that you were dating, is that still going on?

348
00:17:37,452 --> 00:17:38,572
算是吧  怎么了
Uh, pretty much. why?

349
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:39,582
没事  随便问问
Nothing, just catching up.

350
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:41,692
顺便  能让我跟米茜说几句吗
By the way, may I speak to missy, please?

351
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:44,342
当然
Of course.

352
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,192
好啊  莱纳德  什么事
Hi, leonard. what's up?

353
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,732
你明天就走了
Well, since you're leaving tomorrow,

354
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:51,212
我想能不能邀你一起吃顿晚饭?
I was wondering if you'd like to go to dinner with me.

355
00:17:51,642 --> 00:17:53,032
你人真好
That's so sweet.

356
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:54,432
但不用了  谢谢
But no thanks.

357
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:58,432
你有其它安排还是...?
Oh. do you have other plans or...?

358
00:17:58,432 --> 00:18:00,032
没有
No. oh.

359
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:04,692
好吧
All right, uh...

360
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,842
祝你今晚过得愉快
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

361
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:09,702
谢谢  再见
Thanks. see ya.

362
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:19,082
有点世事难料啊
Um, here's something we didn't anticipate.

363
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:26,722
有什么能为你效劳的  霍华德?
What do you want, howard?

364
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:29,172
我很好  多谢关心
I'm fine. thanks for asking.

365
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:32,562
我来拜访下米茜
I've come to call on missy.

366
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:34,342
米茜
Missy.

367
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,732
你好  霍华德
Hi, howard.

368
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,592
是神奇的霍华德
The amazing howard.

369
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,152
喜欢魔术吗
Do you like magic?

370
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,632
不喜欢
Not really. no.

371
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:47,402
那你算是赚到了
Then you are in for a treat.

372
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:51,052
看好  这是根普通的棍子
Behold, an ordinary cane.

373
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:01,012
不
No.

374
00:19:02,332 --> 00:19:03,712
好吧
Okay.

375
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:22,192
米茜
Missy.

376
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,042
谢谢
Thank you.

377
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:26,332
很感...
I apprec...

378
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:29,812
感...
Apprec...

379
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,282
感感感...
Appreeee...

380
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,392
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

381
00:19:35,392 --> 00:19:37,682
是不是你的药效退了?
Is your medication wearing off?

382
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:42,262
你好  开心果
Well, hi, cutie pie.

383
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:44,062
正想着你会出现呢
I was hoping you'd show up.

384
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:14,662
我们家养过的一只狗就发这种声音的
We had a dog who made a noise like that.

385
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:16,232
最后不得不弄死他
Had to put him down.

386
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:24,261
有什么要我跟妈说的吗
Any news you want me to pass along to mom?

387
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:27,911
她可能会愿意知道  我已经把研究重点
She might be interested to know that I have refocused my research

388
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:31,291
从玻色弦论转到了杂交弦论
From bosonic string theory to heterotic string theory.

389
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:34,021
我就跟她说  你向她问好吧
Yeah, I'll just tell her you say "hey."

390
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,631
很高兴能看到你
Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you,

391
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:41,511
除了你对我睾丸干的那事儿
Other than that business with my testicles.

392
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:45,091
来吧  谢利
Come on, shelly.

393
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,051
我要你知道我很以你为荣
I want you to know I'm very proud of you.

394
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:54,141
真的?
Really?

395
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:57,201
当然  我经常跟我朋友们吹嘘我哥哥
Yep, I'm always bragging to my friends about my brother,

396
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:58,491
是火箭专家(美国人对天才科学家的习惯称呼)
The rocket scientist.

397
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:02,171
你跟别人说我是火箭专家?
You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?

398
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,241
对啊
Well, yeah.

399
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:06,401
我是个理论物理学家
I'm a theoretical physicist.

400
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:07,771
有什么区别
What's the difference?

401
00:21:07,771 --> 00:21:09,721
有什么区别?!
What's the difference?!

402
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:11,851
我走了  谢利
Good-bye, shelly.

403
00:21:11,851 --> 00:21:13,971
天呐
My god!

404
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:15,921
你怎么不跟人家说
Why don't you just tell them that

405
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,981
我是金门大桥那儿收通行税的啊?
I'm a toll-taker at the golden gate bridge?!

406
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:24,401
火箭专家  多丢人啊
Rocket scientist. how humiliating.
