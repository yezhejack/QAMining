1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,840
如果一个光子打向有两个狭缝的平面
So if a photon is directed through a plane

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,530
如果有一个狭缝可以观测到  
with two slits in it and either slit is observed,

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,530
那它没有同时通过两个狭缝
it will not go through both slits.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,830
如果观测不到  那它会通过
If it's unobserved,it will.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,390
但如果它是在离开平面后  
However,if it's observed after it's left the plane

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,680
在击中目标物之前被观测到
But before it hits its target,

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,060
那它不会同时通过两个狭缝
it won't have gone through both slits.

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,240
没错  你想说什么
Agreed. what's your point?

9
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,620
没什么  我只是觉得这个主意放在T恤上不错
There's no point,I just think it's a good idea for a t-shirt.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,720
-您好  -稍等
-excuse me. -hang on.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,720
横1是"爱琴海"
One across is "aegean."

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,230
竖8是"纳巴科夫"(1899-1977  俄裔美国小说家)
Eight down is "nabokov."

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,710
横26"MCM"
26 across is "mcm."

14
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,280
竖14是...你手挡住了...
14 down is... move your finger...

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,790
是"门"(生物分类)  所以说横十四是"太子港"(海地首都)
"phylum" which makes 14 across "port-au-prince"

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,650
你看  "Papa Doc"(海地总统绰号)提示了  所以是"太子港"
See,"papa doc's capitol idea," that's "port-au-prince."

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,150
在海地
Haiti.

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,250
-需要帮忙吗  -是的
-can I help you? -yes.

19
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,400
这里是高智商精子库吗
Is this the high-iq sperm bank?

20
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,660
如果这还要问的话  那你可能不该来这
If you have to ask,maybe you shouldn't be here.

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,410
我看就是这儿了
I think this is the place.

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,340
-把表格填了  -谢谢
-fill these out. -thank you.

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,400
-马上就好  -不急
-we'll be right back. -take your time.

24
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,750
我正好把填字游戏做完
I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.

25
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,330
等等
Oh,wait.

26
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,540
莱纳德  我觉得我做不到
Leonard,I don't think I can do this.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,070
开什么玩笑  你都是"半职业选手"了
What,are you kidding? you're a semi-pro.

28
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,580
不是的  我们这是在犯基因欺诈罪
No. we are committing genetic fraud.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,460
我们的精子并不能保证
There's no guarantee that our sperm

30
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,170
将来就能生出高智商的后代
is going to generate high-iqOffspring.

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,940
你想想  我姐姐和我的DNA结构相同
Think about that. I have a sister with the same basic dna mix

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,720
可她只是快餐店的女服务生
Who hostesses at fuddruckers.

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,800
谢尔顿  当初是你要来的
Sheldon,this was your idea.

34
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,170
这点补贴能让我们
A little extra money to get

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,560
在寓所里拥有分式T-1带宽
fractional t-1 bandwidth in the apartment.

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,320
我知道  我的确渴望更快的下载速度
I know,and I do yearn for faster downloads.

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,450
但那些可怜的女人们
But there's some poor woman

38
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,630
会把希望寄托在我精子上的
who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.

39
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,280
如果她最后发现那小不点连曲线下面积
What if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use

40
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,850
该用积分还是微分算都不知道  她会怎么想
An integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve?

41
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,340
-我肯定她还是会爱他的  -我不会
-i'm sure she'll still love him. -i wouldn't.

42
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,010
你现在想怎么样
Well,what do you want to do?

43
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,130
我想走了
I want to leave.

44
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,270
该怎么跟她说呢
What's the protocol for leaving?

45
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,860
我不知道...我以前从来没在捐献精子时中途走人过
I don't know... I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,850
我们就直接走吧
Let's try just walking out.

47
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,230
-再见  -再见  很高兴见到你
-bye. -bye. nice meeting you.

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,930
你还在为那个精子库的事生气吗
Are you still mad about the sperm bank?

49
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,560
没有
No.

50
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,230
你想不想听有关楼梯的有趣事情
You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?

51
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,750
不太想
Not really.

52
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,330
如果有一格阶梯的高度存在哪怕两毫米的微小差距
If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimeters,

53
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,790
-大多数人会被绊倒  -跟我无关
-most people will trip. -i don't care.

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,470
两毫...那不太可能吧
Two milli... that doesn't seem right.

55
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,010
不  是真的  我12岁时做过一系列试验
No,it's true,I did a series of experiments when I was 12

56
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,660
我爸爸还摔断了锁骨
My father broke his clavicle.

57
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,930
你就是因为这个被他们送去寄宿学校的?
Is that why they sent you to boarding school?

58
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,730
不是  是因为我那些关于激光的试验
No. that was a result of my work with lasers.

59
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,770
这是新邻居?
New neighbor?

60
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,990
很明显
Evidently.

61
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,060
比起上一个的水准真是有显著提高
Significant improvement over the old neighbor.

62
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,250
那个体重200磅有皮肤问题的异装癖者?
200-pound transvestite with a skin condition?

63
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,370
那是  没错
Yes,she is.

64
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,750
-你好  -你好
-oh,hi. -hi.

65
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,850
我们不想打搅你  我们就住你对面
We don't mean to interrupt. we live across the hall.

66
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,770
你们真好啊
Oh,that's nice.

67
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,770
我们不是住在一起  我是说...
We don't live together. I mean...

68
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,570
我们是住在一起
We live together,

69
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,670
不过是在分开的  异性恋的卧室里
But in separate,heterosexual bedrooms.

70
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,100
好的
Okay,well...

71
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,160
看来你们就是我的新邻居了  我叫佩妮
Guess I'm your new neighbor. penny.

72
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,210
-我是莱纳德  他是谢尔顿  -你好
-leonard. sheldon. -hi.

73
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,790
那么...
Well...

74
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,000
欢迎成为我们的邻居
Welcome to the building.

75
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,600
谢谢你  我们可以什么时候喝喝咖啡
Thank you. maybe we can have coffee sometime.

76
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,530
很好啊
Great.

77
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,810
-那...再见  -再见
-well... bye. -bye.

78
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,520
我们要不要请她来吃午饭?
Should we have invited her for lunch?

79
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,590
不  我们要开始看太空堡垒卡拉狄加第二季
No.We're gonna start season two of battlestar galactica.

80
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,200
第二季的DVD我们已经看过了
We already watched the season two dvds.

81
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,500
但评论音轨还没看
Not with commentary.

82
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,130
我觉得我们应该做个好邻居
I think we should be good neighbors

83
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,140
请她作客  让她觉得亲切
And invite her over,make her feel welcome.

84
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,320
我们从没请过那个叫路易还是叫路易斯的过来
We never invited louie-slash-louise over.

85
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,170
那是我们的不对
And that was wrong of us.

86
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,740
我们得扩大下我们的朋友圈子
We need to widen our circle.

87
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,280
我的朋友圈子已经很大了
I have a very wide circle.

88
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,210
我的空间上有212个好友
I have 212 friends on myspace.

89
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,340
不错  可他们你一个也没见过
Yes,and you've never met one of them.

90
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,440
这正是其美妙之处
That's the beauty of it.

91
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,450
我要请她过来
I'm gonna invite her over.

92
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,520
我们可以好好吃一顿  然后...聊天
We'll have a nice meal and... chat.

93
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,480
聊天?  我们平时不聊天  至少下了网不聊
Chat? we don't chat. at least not offline.

94
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,190
这没什么难的
It's not difficult.

95
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,830
你只要听着她讲些什么
You just listen to what she says

96
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,770
然后你适当地回应她一些
And then you say something appropriate in response.

97
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,170
那最后要干什么?
To what end?

98
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,750
你好...又来了
Hi... again.

99
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,750
你好
Hi.

100
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,050
那个...
Anyway...

101
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,150
我们带了印度菜回来
We brought home indian food.

102
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,170
然后...
And...

103
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,860
我知道搬家可能会很累
I know that moving can be stressful,

104
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,160
并且我发现当我身心俱疲时
And I find that when I'm undergoing stress,

105
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,440
美食和伙伴能让我感觉很舒坦
That good food and company can have a comforting effect.

106
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,810
还有  咖喱本身有通便功效  我想我不必再说
Also,curry is a natural laxative,and I don't have to tell you

107
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,560
你知道  如果大肠通畅...
That,you know,a clean colon is just...

108
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,670
那又可以少一件操心事了
One less thing to worry about.

109
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,280
这方面我不在行  不过我相信如果是邀请别人吃午餐
I'm no expert,but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation,

110
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,860
你最好不要说些肠运动的事
You might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.

111
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,230
你们是在邀请我过去吃饭?
You're inviting me over to eat?

112
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,810
是的
Yes.

113
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,610
你们真好  我很乐意
Oh,that's so nice. I'd love to.

114
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,780
太好了
Great.

115
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,280
你们平时都玩些什么
So,what do you guys do for fun around here?

116
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,700
今天我们尝试过靠自慰来挣钱
Today we tried masturbating for money.

117
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,670
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第01集
Pilot

118
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,880
好了  就当在自己家一样
Okay,make yourself at home.

119
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
谢谢
Thank you.

120
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,620
不用谢
You're very welcome.

121
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,700
这些东西看上去真深奥啊
This looks like some serious stuff.

122
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,890
-莱纳德  这是你写的?  -不  这是我的
-leonard,did you do this? -actually,that's my work.

123
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,330
不错  只是一些量子力学而已
Yeah. well,it's just some quantum mechanics

124
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,670
边上还随便写了一点点弦理论
With a little string theory doodling around the edges.

125
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,290
那部分  是我开的玩笑
That part there,that's just a joke.

126
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,280
讽刺下波恩-奥本海默近似
It's a spoof of the born-oppenheimer approximation.

127
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,020
这么说  你就像是"美丽心灵"里那种天才一样
So you're like one of those beautiful mind genius guys.

128
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,810
是吧
Yeah.

129
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,040
-真让人赞叹  -我也有块板
-this is really impressive. -i have a board.

130
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,240
如果你喜欢板  这块是我的
If you like boards,this is my board.

131
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,590
上帝啊
Holy smokes.

132
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,170
如果你说"上帝啊"是想
If by "holy smokes",you mean

133
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,160
再一次强调说你能在任何一个麻省理工的
A derivative restatement of the kind of stuff

134
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,340
男生寝室墙上发现那些涂鸦  那一点没错
You can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at mit,sure.

135
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,560
-什么?  -得了吧
-what? -come on.

136
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,290
谁没看到那微分上面写着"我打住了  心碎了  算不下去了"
Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit,broken-hearted"?

137
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,210
至少我不会为了解决个数学问题
At least I didn't have to invent 26 dimensions

138
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,600
去发明个什么26维出来
Just to make the math come out.

139
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,180
我没有创造发明  他们本来就有
I didn't invent them. they're there.

140
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,420
-哪个宇宙有?  -所有的都有...这就是我说的关键
-in what universe? -in all of them... that is the point.

141
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,860
你们介意我先开吃吗
Do you guys mind if I start?

142
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,460
佩妮...
Penny...

143
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,590
这是我的座位
That's where l sit.

144
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,760
那  你坐我旁边
So,sit next to me.

145
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,000
不...我坐那里的
No... I sit there.

146
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,660
有什么区别
What's the difference?

147
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,860
-什么区别?  -开始了
-what's the difference? -here we go.

148
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,970
在冬天  这个位子离暖气比较近所以比较暖和
In the winter,that seat is close enough to the radiator

149
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,940
但也不至于太近以至于引起出汗
To remain warm,and yet not so close as to cause perspiration

150
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,450
在夏天  通过窗子吹进来的风直接在这里交叉
In the summer,it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze

151
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,520
就是这边和那边的窗户
Created by opening windows there and there.

152
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,260
看电视正好有个角度
It faces the television at an angle

153
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,820
不会太正  从而影响跟别人说话
That is neither direct,thus discouraging conversation,

154
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,390
也不会太斜  从而造成脖子酸疼
Nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion.

155
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,720
我还能继续  不过我觉得你已经明白我的意思了
I could go on,but I think I've made my point.

156
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,280
你想让我移开吗
Do you want me to move?

157
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,310
你就随便坐一下吧
-well... -just sit somewhere else.

158
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,590
好的
Fine.

159
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,880
谢尔顿  坐下!
Sheldon,sit!

160
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,830
这样很好啊
Well,this is nice.

161
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,630
不太有人来我们这里作客的
We don't have a lot of company over.

162
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,470
不是吧  库萨帕里和沃尔维茨就经常过来
That's not true. koothrappali and wolowitz come over all the time.

163
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,980
-是  我知道  但...  -星期二晚上
-yes i know,but... -tuesday night,

164
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,940
我们还玩"克林贡拼字游戏"玩到凌晨一点(克林贡是外星人)
We played klingon boggle till 1:00 a.m.

165
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,970
是  我记得
Yeah,I remember.

166
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,930
-不要说我们没有伙伴  -对不起
-don't say we don't have company. -sorry.

167
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,960
-这是社交上很消极的暗示  -我说对不起了
-that has negative social implications. -i said I'm sorry!

168
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,870
"克林贡拼字游戏"?
Klingon boggle?

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,320
是的  就是普通的拼字游戏  只不过...
Yeah. it's like regular boggle,but...

170
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,600
是用克林贡语言
In klingon.

171
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,920
关于我们已经说得够多了  说说你吧
That's probably enough about us. so,tell us about you.

172
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,040
我?  好吧
Me? okay.

173
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,870
我是射手座的
I'm a sagittarius,

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,310
就这一点你们很可能就了解得比我想说的多得多了
Which probably tells you way more than you need to know.

175
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,600
没错  我们可以了解到你有群众性文化妄想
Yes. it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion

176
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,010
就是指你出生时
That the sun's apparent position

177
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,070
相对于任意确定星座的太阳的视位置
Relative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth

178
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,010
可能会决定你的性格
Somehow affects your personality.

179
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,110
有什么来着?
Participate in the what?

180
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,500
我认为谢尔顿是想说
I think what sheldon's trying to say

181
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,520
我们可能不会第一个猜你是"射手座"的
Is that sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.

182
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,170
是  很多人会以为我是水相星座的
Yeah,a lot of people think I'm a water sign.

183
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,750
还有什么  让我想想
Okay,let's see,what else.

184
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,910
我是素食者  但我吃鱼
I'm a vegetarian. except for fish.

185
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,080
偶尔吃牛排  牛排真赞!
And the occasional steak. I love steak!

186
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,810
真有趣
Well,that's interesting.

187
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,160
莱纳德吃玉米会不消化
Leonard can't process corn.

188
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,500
你有什么工作吗
Well... do you have some sort of a job?

189
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,690
有  我是家乳酪蛋糕店的服务生
Yeah. I'm a waitress at the cheesecake factory.

190
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,550
我很喜欢乳酪蛋糕
I love cheesecake.

191
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,730
你不是不能吃乳糖嘛
You're lactose-intolerant.

192
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,290
我是不吃...我只是觉得那东西不错
I don't eat it... I just think it's a good idea.

193
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,730
还有  我正在写一个剧本
Anyways,I'm also writing a screenplay.

194
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,930
讲一个多愁善感的女生从内布拉斯加州的林肯来到了洛杉矶
It's about this sensitive girl who comes to l.a. from lincoln,nebraska,

195
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,570
她本想当名演员  最终却在乳酪蛋糕店当了服务生
To be an actress and winds up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.

196
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,960
看来这是根据你的经历写的
So,it's based on your life.

197
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,240
不  我是来自奥马哈
No,I'm from omaha.

198
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,550
如果真拍成了电影  我会去看的
If that was movie,I would go see it.

199
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,710
我就说  是不错吧?
I know,right?

200
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,010
让我想想  还有什么...
Okay,let's see,what else...

201
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,080
大概就这些了
Guess that's about it.

202
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,090
这就是佩妮的故事了
That's the story of penny.

203
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,780
真不错
It sounds wonderful.

204
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,150
是不错
It was.

205
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,240
直到我爱上了那混蛋!
Until I fell in love with a jerk!

206
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,070
怎么回事?
What's happening?

207
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,380
上帝  你知道吗  我和他同居了4年
God,you know,4 years I lived with him.

208
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,450
整整4年...都跟高中生涯一样长了
4 years... that's like as long as high school.

209
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,580
你花了4年才读完高中?
It took you 4 years to get through high school?

210
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,070
真...不敢相信我竟然那么信任他
It just... I can't believe I trusted him.

211
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,630
我该说些什么吗?  我感觉我该说些什么
Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.

212
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,450
你?  算了  你只会越帮越忙
You? no,you'll only make it worse.

213
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,720
你们想知道最悲哀的是什么吗
You want to know the most pathetic part?

214
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,890
即使我已经恨透了他的谎言  他的不忠
Even though I hate his lying,cheating guts...

215
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,150
我还是爱他
I still love him.

216
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,170
我是不是疯了?
Is that crazy?

217
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:25,970
是疯了
Yes.

218
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,150
不  不是的  这只是...
No,it's not crazy. it's a...

219
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,600
只是一种悖论
It's a paradox.

220
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,350
自然界中到处都存在着悖论  比如说光
Paradoxes are part of nature. think about light.

221
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,950
按照惠更斯的理论  光是一种波
If you look at huygens,light is a wave,

222
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,910
双缝实验证明了这一观点
As confirmed by the double-slit experiments,

223
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,330
不过后来有了爱因斯坦
But then along comes albert einstein

224
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,700
他发现光原来也具有粒子性
And discovers that light behaves like particles,too.

225
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,950
我至少没越帮倒忙
Well,I didn't make it worse.

226
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,370
我真的很抱歉  我真是一团糟
I'm so sorry. I'm such a mess.

227
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,930
最糟的是  我搬家都搬得恶心死了
On top of everything else,I'm all gross from moving

228
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,640
没想到该死的淋浴器还不能用了
And my stupid shower doesn't even work.

229
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,820
我们的可以用啊
Our shower works.

230
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,620
真的?  如果我在这里洗你们会不会介意?
Really? would it be totally weird if I used it?

231
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,970
-会  -不会
-yes. -no.

232
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,090
-不会  -不会
-no. -no.

233
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,310
就在那边
It's right down the hall.

234
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,590
谢谢
Thanks.

235
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,290
你们真是太好了
You guys are really sweet.

236
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,450
这番进步有意思啊
Well,this is an interesting development.

237
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,490
怎么?
How so?

238
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,800
上次有个女人在我们这里轻解罗裳  
It has been some time since we've had a woman

239
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,600
距离现在已经很久了
Take her clothes off in our apartment.

240
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,220
不见得啊  记得感恩节
That's not true. remember at thanksgiving,

241
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,780
我那老年痴呆的祖母上演的那段?
My grandmother with alzheimer's had that episode?

242
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,590
明白了  距离上次有女人
Point taken. it has been some time

243
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,550
在我们这里轻解罗裳  并且看了之后
Since we've had a woman take her clothes off,

244
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,000
我们不想把眼睛给挖出来的  已经很久了
After which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.

245
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,290
其实最糟的是看她切那火鸡
The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.

246
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,190
你现在究竟是要干些什么呢
So what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?

247
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,190
你说什么?
Excuse me?

248
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,500
那女人不会跟你上床的
That woman is not going to have sex with you.

249
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,990
我没有想要跟她上床
I'm not trying to have sex with her.

250
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,120
那就好  这样你就不会失望了
Good. then you won't be disappointed.

251
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,710
你凭什么认为她不会和我上床了
What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me?

252
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,750
我是男的  她是女的
I'm a male and she's a female.

253
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,390
没错  但不是同一物种
Yes,but not of the same species.

254
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,730
我才不跟你讨论什么假设
I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here.

255
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,600
我只想当个好邻居
I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,080
是啊
Of course.

257
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,670
那也不是说如果有机会可以发展肉体关系
That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop,

258
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,340
我会袖手旁观
That I wouldn't participate.

259
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,820
大致是这样
However briefly.

260
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,710
当她发现你的卢克・天行者(星球大战人物)无泪洗发水
Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered

261
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,260
你说这种可能性是会变大了呢还是变小了
When she discovers your luke skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?

262
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,250
那是达斯・维德(另一星战人物)牌洗发水
It's darth vader shampoo.

263
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,820
卢克・天行者是护发素
Luke skywalker's the conditioner.

264
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,140
-先看这个  -太强了  难以置信
-wait till you see this. -it's fantastic,unbelievable.

265
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,260
看什么?
See what?

266
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,630
1974年  史蒂芬霍金在麻省理工的演讲
It's a stephen hawking lecture from mit in 1974.

267
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,840
现在不是时候
This isn't a good time.

268
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,010
那时他还不是这样毛骨悚然的电脑音
It's before he became a creepy computer voice.

269
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,330
-不错  可你们现在必须得走  -为什么
-that's great. you guys have to go. -why?

270
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,650
现在不是时候
It's just not a good time.

271
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,360
莱纳德有女士来访
Leonard has a lady over.

272
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,460
是的  我明白了...你祖母又回城来了?
Yeah,right... your grandmother back in town?

273
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,270
不是  她不是什么女士  她是新来的邻居
No. And she's not a lady. she's just a new neighbor.

274
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,960
等等  这里真的有位女士?
Hang on,there really is a lady here?

275
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,180
你赶我们走是为了想要和她交媾?
And you want us out because you're anticipating coitus?

276
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,320
我没有想要和她交媾
I'm not anticipating coitus.

277
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,740
那就是说别人现在可以和她交媾?
So she's available for coitus?

278
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,240
我们可不可以不要说"交媾"这个词了
Can we please just stop saying "coitus"?

279
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,140
更精确的说法应该是"体外射精"
Technically,that would be"coitus interruptus. "

280
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,910
是不是应该有个旋关把水从浴缸那里弄到淋浴器上
Hey,is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower...?

281
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,530
不好意思  大家好
Hi. sorry. hello.

282
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,620
很高兴认识您  女士
Enchant? mademoiselle.

283
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,600
我是霍华德・沃尔维茨  加州工学院应用物理系学生
Howard wolowitz,caltech department of applied physics.

284
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,860
我的一些研究成果你可能已经很熟悉了
You may be familiar with some of my work.

285
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,490
它正在围绕着木星的最大卫星轨道运行
It's currently orbiting jupiter's largest moon

286
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,040
拍摄高分辨率的数码照片
Taking high-resolution digital photographs.

287
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,440
我是佩妮  我在乳酪蛋糕店工作
Penny. I work at the cheesecake factory.

288
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,860
我带你去弄那旋关吧
I'll show you the trick with the shower.

289
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,390
"Bonne douche"
Bonne douche.

290
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,540
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

291
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,520
是法语里"洗个痛快澡"的意思
It's french for "good shower. "

292
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,320
是一句祝词  我能用六种语言来说
It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.

293
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,910
还是留着博客上说吧  霍华德
Save it for your blog,howard.

294
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,910
洗个痛快澡

295
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,320
好了  没问题了  是卡住了  不好意思
All right,there it goes. it sticks. I'm sorry.

296
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,990
-好的  谢谢  -不用谢
-okay,thanks. -you're welcome.

297
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,150
你只要站在...  好吧  我...
You're just gonna to step right... okay,I'll...

298
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,790
-等等  莱纳德  -洗头的那些东西都是谢尔顿的
-hey,leonard? -the hair products are sheldon's.

299
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,650
我能让你帮个忙吗
Can I ask you a favor?

300
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,780
帮个忙?
A favor?

301
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,510
当然  你可以让我帮你忙  我可以帮你个忙
Sure,you can ask me a favor. I would do you a favor for you.

302
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,840
你如果不愿意也没关系
It's okay if you say no.

303
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,580
我应该会愿意的
I'll probably say yes.

304
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,140
一般你刚认识某个人  不会请求一件这样的事
It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met.

305
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,200
我真的觉得我们该好好想想这里面的因果关系了
I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.

306
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,700
-有必要吗  -事件一
-must we? -event a...

307
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,940
我们那淋浴器下站着个裸体美女
A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower.

308
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,470
事件二  我们开车穿过半个城市到上述那位女性的
Event b... we drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set

309
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,480
前男友住处取回一台电视机
From the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend.

310
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,760
提问  在哪个层面上
Query... on what plane of existence

311
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,100
这两个事件哪怕是有半点合理的联系
Is there even a semi-rational link between these events?

312
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,560
她请求我帮她个忙  谢尔顿
She asked me to do her a favor,sheldon.

313
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,400
是啊  这可能是我们这趟旅途最近似的原因了
Yes,well,that may be the proximal cause of our journey,

314
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,920
但其只存在于更高层次原因的对比之下
But we both know it only exists in contradistinction

315
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,900
这点我们都清楚
To the higher level distal cause.

316
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,270
-是什么  -你在用下半身在思考
-which is? -you think with your penis.

317
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,100
从生理上说这是不可能的  还有  你可以不用跟来啊
That's a biological impossibility. and you didn't have to come.

318
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,230
不错  我可以留在那儿看着沃尔维茨勾引佩妮
Right,I could have stayed behind and watch wolowitz try to hit on penny

319
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,910
用俄语  阿拉伯语  波斯语
In russian,arabic and farsi.

320
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,590
为什么她自己不去取回电视机
Why can't she get her own tv?

321
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,650
得了  你知道分手是怎么回事
Come on,you know how it is with breakups.

322
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,880
我不知道...  你也不知道
No,I don't... and neither do you.

323
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,560
我以前跟乔伊斯・金分手过
I broke up with joyce kim.

324
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,930
你没有和乔伊斯・金分手  是她投奔回朝鲜了
You did not break up with joyce kim. she defected to north korea.

325
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,890
去缝补她破碎的心啊
To mend her broken heart.

326
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,020
现在这情况远没那么复杂
This situation is much less complicated.

327
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,770
就谁该得到这台电视的拥有权
There's some kind of dispute between penny and her ex-boyfriend

328
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,510
佩妮和她前男友有过争吵
As to who gets custody of the tv.

329
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,770
她只是不想和他再大吵大闹
She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.

330
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,870
-所以我们去和他大吵大闹  -不  我们不用和他去吵的
-so we get to have a scene with him? -no,there's not going to be a scene.

331
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,940
我们两个人  他才一个
There's two of us and one of him.

332
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,820
莱纳德  我们两个甚至搬不动一台电视
Leonard,the two of us can't even carry a tv.

333
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,850
这么说  你们和莱纳德还有谢尔顿一起在大学里共事?
So,you guys work with leonard and sheldon at the university?

334
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,650
抱歉  你会说英语吗
I'm sorry,do you speak english?

335
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,170
他会说英语  他只是不会同女人说话
He speaks english. he just can't speak to women.

336
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,330
真的?  为什么?
Really? why?

337
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,530
他是个怪才吧
He's kind of a nerd.

338
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,110
喝果汁?
Juice box?

339
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,520
我来说话
I'll do the talking.

340
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,810
-谁?  -你好  我是莱纳德  这是谢尔顿
-yeah? -hi,I'm leonard,this is sheldon.

341
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,550
-你好  -我刚说...
-hello. -what did I just--

342
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,690
-我们是来拿佩妮的电视机的  -你们走吧
-we're here to pick up penny's tv. -get lost.

343
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,980
好的  抱歉打扰了
Okay,thanks for you time.

344
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,440
我们不能就这样放弃了
We're not going to give up just like that.

345
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,970
莱纳德  电视机在楼上
Leonard,the tv's in the building.

346
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,890
我们已经被阻止进入大楼了  因此  我们没戏了
We've been denied access to the building,ergo,we are done.

347
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,020
我很抱歉  如果我当初遇到点小麻烦就放弃的话
Excuse me. if I were to give up on the first little hitch,

348
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,790
我永远也不会在宇宙大爆炸之后
I never would have identified the fingerprints of string theory

349
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,700
成功验证弦理论了
In the aftermath of the big bang.

350
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,110
我道歉  你准备怎么做?
My apologies. what's your plan?

351
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,250
能目睹你动脑 实在很荣幸
It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.

352
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,750
不会吧  我们的智商加起来有360呢
Come on,we have a combined iq of 360.

353
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,760
我们应该有办法想出如何进那该死的楼
We should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.

354
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,590
你认为她们的智商加起来有多少?
What do you think their combined iq is?

355
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,610
快把门抵住
Just grab the door!

356
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,330
就这里了
This is it.

357
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,030
我来说话
I'll do the talking.

358
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,460
想得不错  我来当打手
Good thinking. I'll just be the muscle.

359
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,110
什么事
Yeah?

360
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,970
我是莱纳德  这是谢尔顿
I'm leonard,this is sheldon.

361
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,450
刚对讲机里的
From the intercom.

362
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,190
你们到底是怎么进来的?
How the hell did you get in the building?

363
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,020
我们是科学家
We're scientists.

364
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,790
告诉他我们的智商
Tell him about our iq.

365
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,360
-莱纳德  -怎么?
-leonard... -what?

366
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,880
-那裤子是我妈买给我的  -对不起
-my mom bought me those pants. -i'm sorry.

367
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,200
你得打电话跟她说一下
You're going to have to call her.

368
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,750
谢尔顿  拖你下水了  真的很抱歉
Sheldon,I am so sorry I dragged you through this.

369
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,660
没关系  这不是我的第一条裤子  也不会是最后一条
It's okay. it wasn't my first pantsing and it won't be my last.

370
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,060
关于我的动机你说得没错
And you were right about my motives.

371
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,540
我是指望和佩妮能建立关系
I was hoping to establish a relationship with penny

372
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,670
或许有一天可以和她上床
That might have someday led to sex.

373
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,740
你倒是脱下了我的裤子
Well,you got me out of my pants.

374
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,580
好了  反正我买到教训了
Anyway,I've learned my lesson.

375
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,540
她和我不是一类人  我跟她玩完了
She's out of my league,I'm done with her.

376
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,590
我有工作要干  有一天我会赢得诺贝尔奖
Got my work,one day I'll win the nobel prize

377
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,860
然后孤单地死去
And then I'll die alone.

378
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,990
不要这么想  你不会孤单地死去的
Don't think like that. you're not going to die alone.

379
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,540
谢谢  谢尔顿  你真是好朋友
Thank you,sheldon. you're a good friend.

380
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,330
而且你肯定不会拿诺贝尔奖的
And you're certainly not going to win a nobel prize.

381
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,440
这是我搜寻猎物后最喜欢的交付地之一
This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest.

382
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,200
这里的麦酒太棒了
They have a great house ale.

383
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,930
好酷的老虎
Cool tiger.

384
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,010
是的  我从第十级开始就有了
Yeah,I've had him since level ten.

385
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,790
他叫扣扣
His name is buttons.

386
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,730
如果你有自己的游戏人物
Anyway,if you had your own game character

387
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,150
也许我们可以一起  出去搜寻猎物  
We could hang out,maybe go on a quest.

388
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,940
听上去很有意思
That sounds interesting.

389
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,320
你会考虑一下?
You'll think about it?

390
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,170
我没办法不去想它
I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.

391
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,200
很成功啊
Smooth.

392
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,540
我们回来了
We're home.

393
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,740
上帝啊  发生什么事了
My god,what happened?

394
