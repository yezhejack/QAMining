1
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,441
我 的 字 是谢尔顿
Wo de zing shi sheldon.

2
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:06,851
不  应该是
Non, c'est...

3
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:09,951
我 的 名 字 是谢尔顿
Wo de ming zi shi sheldon.

4
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:13,831
我 的 名 字 是谢尔顿
Wo de ming zi shi sheldon.

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:15,571
这算什么?
What's this?

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,741
你不是这么做的嘛
That's what you did.

7
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,901
我以为在某些语言里
I assumed, as in a number of languages,

8
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:22,611
手势也是表达的一部分
That the gesture was part of the phrase.

9
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:24,781
不是
Well, it's not.

10
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:28,441
我又怎么知道?  作为老师  你有义务
How am I supposed to know that? as the teacher, it's your obligation

11
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,621
把个人习惯从教学过程中排除
To separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.

12
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:34,581
你知道  我真的很高兴你决定学习普通话
You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn mandarin.

13
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,191
-为什么?  -一旦你学得溜了
-why? -once you're fluent,

14
00:00:36,311 --> 00:00:39,041
你就又多了十几亿的人去烦  我就解放了
You'll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.

15
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:43,341
梅毒驴子
Mei du lui zi.

16
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:46,911
你刚才叫莱纳德是个得了梅毒的驴子
You just called leonard a syphilitic donkey.

17
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:49,851
向你道歉
My apologies,

18
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:51,921
我的水平只是和老师一样好
I'm only as good as my teacher.

19
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:54,741
你为什么要学中文?
Why are you learning chinese?

20
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:57,141
我认为四川菜馆故意用
I believe the szechuan palace has been passing off

21
00:00:57,261 --> 00:01:00,691
香橙鸡丁来假冒陈皮鸡丁  所以我要去对峙
Orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them.

22
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:03,851
如果我是你  我会更关心
If I were you, I'd be more concerned

23
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:05,901
他们是拿什么假冒了鸡丁
About what they are passing off as chicken.

24
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:11,621
-我要用一下你们的窗户  -随意
-i need to use your window. -sure, go ahead.

25
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:16,241
不要脸的  你落了ipod
Hey, jerk face, you forgot your ipod!

26
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:20,961
-怎么了这是  -我来告诉你这是怎么了
-what's going on? -i'll tell you what's going on.

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,691
那自恋的蠢蛋把我们的性生活写进了博客里
That stupid self-centered bastar wrote about our sex life in his blog.

28
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:29,871
去死吧  你个自恋的蠢蛋!
Drop dead, you stupid self-centered bastard!

29
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,281
谢谢
Thank you.

30
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:38,311
好吧  我们讲到哪儿了
Okay, where were we?

31
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:41,811
别急  我要先搜索一个博客
Not now, I have a blog to find.

32
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,581
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第17集（本季终）
The.Tangerine.Factor

33
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:14,094
佩妮  你还好吧
Penny, are you okay?

34
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:16,164
我很好  莱纳德  你走吧
I'm fine, leonard. just go away!

35
00:02:17,774 --> 00:02:20,704
我知道分手会让人很难过...
I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful...

36
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:22,954
-给我走!  -好吧  开心点  再见
-go away! -okay, feel better! bye!

37
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,384
她不想说话
She doesn't want to talk.

38
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:34,684
没什么惊讶的  佩妮的情感来自于
Not surprising. penny's emotional response is originated

39
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:37,524
最原始的脑部  也就是扁桃形结构
In the primitive portion of the brain, known as the amygdala.

40
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:39,044
然而话语功能处于最后发育的
While speech is centered in the

41
00:02:39,044 --> 00:02:40,554
新大脑皮质中心位置
Much more recently developed neo-cortex.

42
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:42,604
前者可以轻易统治后者
The former can easily overpower the latter,

43
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:44,134
科学已经证实这就是
Giving scientific credence to

44
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:45,864
"无话可说"的概念
The notion of being "rendered speechless."

45
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:54,124
或者她就是不想说话
Or maybe she just doesn't want to talk.

46
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,624
看  我捡到了一个ipod
Look, I found an ipod!

47
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:05,424
都摔得不成样子了  你打算怎么处理
It's smashed beyond repair. what are you gonna do with it?

48
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:08,734
还能怎么办  贴个"九成新"的标签上eBay卖了
What else? sell it on ebay as "slightly used."

49
00:03:09,994 --> 00:03:11,904
是佩妮男朋友的  他们分手了
It was penny's boyfriend's, they broke up.

50
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:15,354
很显然  他把他们私人生活的细节放在了
Apparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship

51
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:18,724
他的博客上  可我却怎么都找不到
On his blog which I cannot find anywhere.

52
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:22,924
我要回去再试着和她聊聊
I'm gonna go back and try talking to her again.

53
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:24,754
好主意  坐在她身旁
Good idea, sit with her.

54
00:03:24,874 --> 00:03:26,234
抱着她  安慰她
Hold her, comfort her.

55
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:28,044
如果你觉得时机不错
And if the moment feels right,

56
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:30,014
看看可不可以趁虚而入
See if you can cop a feel.

57
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:34,184
我才不会趁人之危  霍华德
I'm not going to do that, howard.

58
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:35,664
我倒完全没意识到现在
I'm not aware of a new social

59
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:38,014
有什么要求你进行干预和调解的社交习俗
Convention that requires you to intervene at all.

60
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:39,954
那么处在痛苦中的少女呢
What about damsel in distress?

61
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:39,954
1937年上映美国电影 歌舞/爱情/喜剧

62
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:43,314
12世纪骑士的行为准则?  又不是现在
Twelfth century code of chivalry? not exactly current.

63
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:46,634
你还必须要先成为骑士才可以这么做
You'd also have to be knighted for that to apply.

64
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:50,244
我才不管  她很难过  我要过去
I don't care. she's upset, I'm going over there.

65
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,254
记得在手上坐一会  让它们暖和一点
Remember to sit on your hands a bit, so they're warm.

66
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:55,544
我是她朋友
I'm her friend.

67
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:57,934
我不会在她正脆弱的时候去利用她
I'm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.

68
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:01,034
你的意思是  如果在绝望之极时
So you're saying, if in the depths of despair,

69
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:03,604
她主动向你投怀送抱
She throws herself at you and demands you take her,

70
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:06,194
当时当下  你就头不回走人?
Right there, right now, you'll just walk away?

71
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:09,174
我说我是她朋友  又不是同志朋友
I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.

72
00:04:14,614 --> 00:04:16,774
听着  我知道你不想说话...
Listen, I know you said you didn't want to talk...

73
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:18,334
-我不想  -对不起
-i don't. -sorry.

74
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:21,094
-等等  -等等?  你说"等等"?
-wait! -wait? did you say "wait"?

75
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:24,764
跟我说实话
Tell me the truth.

76
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:28,174
我是不是那种整天跟大混蛋在一起的傻瓜
Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?

77
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:33,554
那么我就是跟好人在一起  然后把他们都变成了混蛋
So I pick good guys but turn them into losers.

78
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:35,184
当然不是
of course not.

79
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:37,894
非此即彼  到底是哪个
It's gotta be one or the other. which is it?

80
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:46,104
抱歉  是哪两个选项来着?
I'm sorry, what were the choices again?

81
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:48,404
我真的以为麦克与众不同
I really thought mike was different.

82
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:49,824
我以为他...
I thought he was...

83
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:51,684
体贴  又聪明
Sensitive and smart,

84
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:54,944
我不是指你那种聪明  是普通不吓人的那种
I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart.

85
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:56,704
是  是  当然
Yeah, no, sure.

86
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:59,234
现在他跑过来羞辱我
And then he just goes and has to humiliate me

87
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:02,794
在博客上写些关于我的东西让全世界的人来看
By writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.

88
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:05,434
跟你说吧  那博客不容易被找到的
I tell you, it's not all that easy to find.

89
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:08,914
真的?  跟我要好的同事看到了  我姐姐看到了
Really? my friends at work found it, my sister found it.

90
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:10,954
从电子邮件来看  一些在密歇根州
Judging by my email, a number of prisoners

91
00:05:11,074 --> 00:05:13,594
监狱里的牢犯也看到了
At the michigan state penitentiary found it.

92
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:16,014
那家伙究竟写了什么
What exactly did this guy write?

93
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:19,684
我不是说想知道你性生活的细节  只是想...
Not that I need to know the details of your sex life. I just thought...

94
00:05:20,774 --> 00:05:21,834
算了
Never mind.

95
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:24,024
不用
No, you know what?

96
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:27,344
你可以去看  所有人都看了  去吧
You might as well read it. everybody else has. go ahead.

97
00:05:27,884 --> 00:05:31,234
上帝  我感觉被如此地出卖和羞辱
Oh, god, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed!

98
00:05:31,354 --> 00:05:34,124
只想钻进洞里然后死去
I just want to crawl into a hole and die!

99
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:40,284
你看  这其实没那么糟糕
Okay. well, you know, this isn't that bad.

100
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:42,244
只是描绘了一幅
It just paints the picture

101
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:44,214
浓情蜜意的女人
Of a very affectionate woman,

102
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:46,784
在非传统地点场合
Who's open to expressing her affection

103
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,424
开放地表达她的情感
In non-traditional locales.

104
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,024
天啊
Oh, god!

105
00:05:51,714 --> 00:05:53,514
电梯里  公园里
Elevators, parks,

106
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:56,024
电影院里
Movie theaters.

107
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,074
好奇问一下
Out of curiosity,

108
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:01,304
这里的"地铁"是指交通运输系统
Is this "subway" the transportation system

109
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:03,354
还是那个叫"地铁"的三明治店?
Or subway the sandwich shop?

110
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:05,744
三明治店
Sandwich shop.

111
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:09,774
这是不是违反了卫生许可啊
Doesn't that violate the health code?

112
00:06:10,344 --> 00:06:12,314
没有  在那里我们只是亲热了一下
No, at the sub shop we were only making out.

113
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:16,444
我是想说
But my point is that

114
00:06:16,604 --> 00:06:19,034
你完全没有理由觉得尴尬啊
You have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.

115
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:22,154
真的吗?  你是不是认为我反应太过了?
Really? do you think I overreacted?

116
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:25,434
-可能有一点  -我确实经常这样  我是个容易过激的人
-maybe a little. -because I do that. I do overreact.

117
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:27,454
也许我应该打电话跟麦克道歉
Maybe I should call mike and apologize.

118
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:30,834
你这样反应就变成太不过了
That would be under-reacting.

119
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,894
他确实把卧室里的隐私都暗示出来了
He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom.

120
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:39,014
在你的橱里  电梯  公园  还有在快餐店
And in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise.

121
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:42,974
你说得对  我就应该说"我跟他玩完了"
You're right. I should just say "i am done with him."

122
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:44,934
对  你就该这么说  说吧
Yes, you should. go ahead, say it.

123
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:48,184
但是我还没有给这个男人解释的机会
But I never gave the man a chance to explain.

124
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,174
有什么好解释的
What is there to explain?

125
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:51,434
都写在这里了
It's all right here.

126
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,094
出卖啊!
The betrayal!

127
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:56,224
不  你一开始是对的
No, you were right the first time.

128
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:59,634
这个男人只是用他自己那种很傻的办法爱着我
This is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way,

129
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:02,284
只是在向世人宣告他的感受
Which is trying to sw w people how he feels.

130
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:05,684
我很肯定我没这么说
I'm pretty sure I never said that.

131
00:07:06,924 --> 00:07:08,534
是  你做得更了不起
No, you did better than that.

132
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:10,254
你让我自己发现了这个事实
You helped me see it on my own.

133
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,874
我真棒啊
Oh, good for me.

134
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:14,644
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

135
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:16,084
我去麦克那儿
I'm going over to mike's.

136
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:17,464
莱纳德  太感谢你了
Leonard, thank you so much.

137
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:18,494
没事
Oh, sure.

138
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:27,334
也许我真是她的同性恋朋友
Huh, maybe I am her gay friend.

139
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:36,834
霍华德  我想我还需要继续上中文课
Howard, I'm going to nd d another mandarin lesson.

140
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:38,084
很显然  那些人还是
I obviously didn't make

141
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:39,864
听不懂我在说什么
My point with those people.

142
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:41,934
谢尔顿  看在老天的份上
For god's sake, sheldon,

143
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,534
如果你不喜欢陈皮鸡丁
If you don't like the ngngerine chicken,

144
00:07:43,544 --> 00:07:45,274
就不要点陈皮鸡丁
Don't order the tangerine chicken.

145
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:46,504
我喜欢吃陈皮鸡丁
I like tangerine chicken,

146
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:48,654
只是他们给我的压根不是陈皮鸡丁
I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.

147
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:52,164
能不能聊点别的?
Can we please change the subject?

148
00:07:52,184 --> 00:07:53,054
当然
Sure.

149
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:54,274
我们聊聊你是怎么
Ll us again how you screwed up

150
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:56,374
让佩妮回到她前男友身边的吧
And got penny back together witherer old boyfriend.

151
00:07:58,204 --> 00:07:59,454
扔你的骰子
Just roll the dice.

152
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,594
"被魔术师俘虏
"enslaved by warlocks.

153
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:07,294
只有掷出二  四  六才可以离开"
Stay here until you roll two, four or six."

154
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:09,254
她本来在生他的气的!
She was mad at him!

155
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:10,924
她本来跟他玩完了!
She was done with him!

156
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:12,714
这段感情已经是不可能挽回的了
E e relationship was broken beyond repair,

157
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:15,204
而我跑过去  让他们和好了
And I walked over there, and I fixed it.

158
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:19,584
天啊  这个故事真是越听越精彩...
Boy, that story gets better every time you hear ..

159
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:22,754
实际上  我觉得前两个版本
Actually, I thought the first two renditions

160
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:23,914
要吸引人得多
Were far more compelling.

161
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:26,674
之前  我对那个叫莱纳德的角色是报以同情
Previously, I felt sympathy for the leonard character,

162
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:29,134
现在我只是觉得他很怨妇
Now I just find him to be whiny and annoying.

163
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:33,014
吃你的陈皮鸡丁去
Eat your tangerine chicken.

164
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:36,134
我也想吃啊  可我这根本不是陈皮鸡丁
I'd love to, but I don' have tangerine chicken.

165
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:42,094
非常感谢你愚蠢的建议!
Thank you so much for your stupid advice!

166
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:48,864
不可思议
Incredible.

167
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:51,504
你把搞砸的事情又搞砸了
You managed to screw up the screw-up.

168
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,154
我又来了
I'm back.

169
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:01,994
对不起  刚才我吼你了
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

170
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:03,344
又不是你的错
It's not your fault.

171
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:05,154
怎么啦
What happened?

172
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:08,444
我去麦克那想跟他和好
Well, I went over to mike's to make up with him.

173
00:09:08,454 --> 00:09:10,254
是  不用说  我知道这部分
Yeah. no, I know that part.

174
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:13,524
但他已经有新欢了
But he had already moved on.

175
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:15,184
已经?  好快啊
Already? that was quick.

176
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:16,484
我就是这么对
That's what I said to the woman

177
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:19,684
那个把脚缠在他脖子上的女人说的
Who had her legs wrapped around his neck!

178
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:24,584
佩妮  我也很难过
Oh, penny, I am so sorry.

179
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:27,014
他怎么能这样?!
How could he do that?!

180
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,414
你要知道  你把他80G的IPOD给了...
Well, you know, you did throw an 80-gig ipod...

181
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:32,874
对呀  他怎么能这样对你
Yeah, no, how could he do that?

182
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:36,404
我发誓我再也不跟这样的男人交往了
I swear to god I am done with guys like that.

183
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:40,434
那种身材好  发型帅  有钱的男人
You know, macho with the perfect body and the hair and the money.

184
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:42,214
是  他们肯定老得很快
Yeah, that must get old quick.

185
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:45,274
你知道吗  这一次
You know, just once

186
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,054
我真的想和一个
I would like to go out with someone

187
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:51,974
善良诚实  真正关心我的人约会
Who is nice and honest and who actually cares about me.

188
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:54,844
我怎么样?
What about me?

189
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:57,104
你什么怎么样?
What about you what?

190
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:01,984
你和我约会怎么样?
What about if you went out with me?

191
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:06,374
你是在约我出去?
Are you asking me out?

192
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:10,254
是  我是
Um, yes, I am...

193
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:11,764
在约你出去
Asking you out.

194
00:10:15,644 --> 00:10:17,994
我只是顺着你的话在说...
I was just going off your comment about the nice guy...

195
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:18,664
-我明白  -诚实啊什么的
No, I know, I got that. you know, and honest.

196
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:20,384
对啊
Yeah, totally.

197
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:21,834
...没有什么的
So, but... it's no big deal.

198
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:22,864
好
Yes.

199
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,244
好什么?
Yes what?

200
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:28,184
好  我愿意和你去约会
Yes, I will go out with you.

201
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:33,024
真的吗?
Really?

202
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,304
是
Yeah.

203
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:37,294
有什么不可以的
Why not?

204
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,674
我已经倾尽所有了
I mean, what do I have to lose?

205
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:41,174
确实
Yeah.

206
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:44,554
就该这样想
That's the spirit.

207
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:52,414
给我看你们的陈皮
Show me your citrus peels.

208
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:55,924
给我看你们的陈皮
Gay wo k n ni de jud zi pee.

209
00:10:57,154 --> 00:10:59,374
给我看你们的陈皮
Show me your citrus peels.

210
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:02,814
给我看你们的陈皮
Gay wo kan ni de jud zi pee.

211
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:03,564
-给我看你们的  -谢尔顿?
Show me your... sheldon?

212
00:11:03,574 --> 00:11:05,874
哎呀  吓死我了
Ai yah!xia si wo le

213
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:09,044
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:11,224
你有时间吗(second还有次等的意思)
Look, do you have a second?

215
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:13,564
次等的什么  内衣?
A second what, pair of underwear?

216
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:16,334
我是在问你是否有空和我聊聊
I was just wondering if I could talk to you.

217
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:17,664
是关于莱纳德
It's about leonard.

218
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:18,994
为什么和我聊
Why me?

219
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:21,214
为什么不和库萨帕里或者沃尔维茨聊
Why not koothrappali or wolowitz?

220
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:23,964
拉杰不能和我说话  除非他喝醉了
Well, raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk,

221
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,594
而沃尔维茨  你知道的  他令人恶心
And wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.

222
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,604
是的  我也这么认为
Yes, I suppose he is

223
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:34,214
我想说的是  你最了解莱纳德了
All I'm saying is, you know leordrd the best.

224
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:35,414
不一定
Not necessarily.

225
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:36,764
我常会惊讶于
I'm often surprised

226
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:38,634
自己对莱纳德了解的匮乏
By my lack of familiarity with leonard.

227
00:11:38,644 --> 00:11:40,144
前几天我发现
Just the other day I discovered

228
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:41,784
他不仅有丝瓜络
He not only has a loofah,

229
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:43,344
而且还藏起来
He hides it.

230
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:46,484
你说为什么一个男人会为使用丝瓜络而感到羞耻
Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah?

231
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:49,414
我个人来说  更乐于让自己的上皮细胞
I, myself, prefer to have my excess epithelial cells

232
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:51,704
自然脱落  但是我也不责备
Slough off naturally, but I d't condemn

233
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:53,574
那些试图加速这个过程的人
Those who seek to accelerate the process.

234
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:56,644
...而且直到最近我才知道
...and until recently I had no idea

235
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:58,594
尽管他对乳糖过敏
That despite his lactose intolerance,

236
00:11:58,604 --> 00:12:01,524
但他吃少量不含脂的冰淇淋
He can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream

237
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:03,734
却不会产生在我看来
Without producing a noxious gas that I maintain,

238
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:06,024
如果适当浓缩  可以成为生化武器的有毒气体
In the right concentration, could be weaponize

239
00:12:08,014 --> 00:12:09,164
莱纳德可能会回来
Leonard might come home.

240
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:10,684
能去我屋里聊吗
Can we talk in my apartment?

241
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,164
我们还没聊完?
We're not done?

242
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:15,344
没有
No.

243
00:12:15,354 --> 00:12:16,574
那好吧
Eh, why not?

244
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:18,624
反正我们已经穿过镜子了(源于"爱丽丝镜中奇遇记")
We're already through the looking glass anyway.

245
00:12:22,504 --> 00:12:24,934
好  事情是这样的
Okay, so here's the thing...

246
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:28,474
我想你已经知道  莱纳德向我开口了
I guess you're aware that leonard asked me out.

247
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:30,634
他虽然事实上什么都没有说
Well, he didn't actually say anything,

248
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:32,234
但他回到房间后
But when he came back to the apartment

249
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:34,214
跳起了一支让人能联想起
He was doing a dance that brought to mind

250
00:12:34,224 --> 00:12:35,974
幻想曲里那只开心河马的舞蹈
The happy hippos in fantasia.

251
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:38,744
他真好
Oh, that's nice.

252
00:12:39,254 --> 00:12:41,384
无论如何  我想和你说的是
Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about

253
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,604
你知道  自从我和莱纳德成为朋友以来...
Is, you know, since leonard and I have become friends...

254
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:44,894
我只是...
I was just...

255
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:46,724
你要坐下来吗
You want to sit down?

256
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,994
能那样简单就好了
Oh, I wish it were that simple.

257
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:52,584
我没在这里待过多久
See, I don't spend much time here,

258
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:55,174
所以我还从来没有选过一个地方来坐
And so I've never really chosen a place to sit.

259
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:56,364
那选吧
Well, choose.

260
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:59,354
这里有许许多多的选择  而且...
There are a number of options, and...

261
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:02,854
我真的不够熟悉座垫的密度
I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities,

262
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:05,194
气流模式和阳光的散射
Air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight

263
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:06,784
来以便做出一个理性的选择
To make an informed choice.

264
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,974
好吧  那你就任意选一处坐
All right.why don't you just pick one at random

265
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:11,194
如果你不喜欢  下次来再换一个地方
And if you don't like it you can sit somewhere else next time.

266
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:12,614
不  不  那样太疯狂了
No, no. that's crazy.

267
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:17,184
你继续说  我一边听一边找
You go ahead and talk while I figure it out.

268
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,194
好吧
Okay.

269
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:22,574
是这样的
Um, here's the thing.

270
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,194
我已经知道
So I've known for a while now

271
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,484
莱纳德他有点
That leonard has had

272
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:27,034
喜欢我...
A little crush on me...

273
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:28,754
有点喜欢?
A little crush?

274
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:32,084
我想是的...就像斯巴达王墨涅劳斯
Well, I suppose so--in the same way menelaus

275
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,104
有点喜欢特洛伊的海伦一样
Had a "little crush" on helen of troy.

276
00:13:35,884 --> 00:13:37,514
好吧  我不知道这些人是谁  但...
All right, yeah, I don't really know who they are, but...

277
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:39,134
墨涅劳斯是阿迦门农的兄弟...
Well, menelaus was the brother of agamemnon...

278
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:40,964
不用了  不用了  听着
I don't care. I don't care. listen.

279
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:42,684
我要说的是
The point is,

280
00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:45,914
莱纳德不是那种经常会和我约会的人
Leonard isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with.

281
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:48,714
莱纳德不是那种经常会和任何人约会的人
Leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with.

282
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:53,184
你是否介意把沙发顺时针旋转30度
Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

283
00:13:53,194 --> 00:13:55,194
不行  我想说的是
No. what I'm saying is

284
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:58,204
莱纳德与其他人不同可能是件好事
Leonard might be different in a good way.

285
00:13:58,324 --> 00:14:01,424
很明显  我平时的选择都不怎么的好
Obviously, my usual choices have not worked out so well.

286
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:03,474
你上一个对库萨帕里来说很好
Your last one worked out well for koothrappali.

287
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:04,914
他得到了一个免费的ipod
He got a free ipod.

288
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:08,864
刺眼
Oh, glare.

289
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:12,254
但换个角度来说  如果和莱纳德进展不顺利
On the other hand, if things don't go well with leonard,

290
00:14:12,264 --> 00:14:14,434
我可能会失去一个很好的朋友
I risk losing a really good friend.

291
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,394
我意思是  他不会是一时放纵的人
I mean, I'm guessing he's not looking for a fling.

292
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:18,254
他是那种陷入一段感情后会持续
He's the kind of guy that gets into a relationship

293
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:20,744
我不知道  可能你会说  光年
For, I don't know, like you would say, light years.

294
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,144
我不会那么说
I would not say that.

295
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:22,864
没有人
No one

296
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:23,584
会那么说
Would say that.

297
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:26,304
光年是一个距离单位而不是一个时间单位
A light year is a unit of distance not time.

298
00:14:26,774 --> 00:14:28,534
谢谢你的说明
Thank you for the clarification.

299
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:37,094
通风口
Draft.

300
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:39,994
人们听到年这个词的时候
See, people hear the word "year"

301
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,344
他们想到的是持续的一段时间
And they think duration.

302
00:14:41,354 --> 00:14:43,194
"尺磅"也有这样的问题...
"foot-pound" has the same problem--

303
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:45,144
它是一个能量单位  而不是一个重量单位
That's a unit of work, not of weight.

304
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:46,354
没错  谢谢
Right. thanks.

305
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:47,344
这是常识性错误
It's common mistake.

306
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,284
这不是我今天犯的第一个错了
Not the first one I've made today.

307
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:51,774
好
Okay.

308
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:54,284
我觉得这就是我的座位了
I think this will be my seat.

309
00:14:55,464 --> 00:14:56,984
谢尔顿  你有什么可以说的吗
Sheldon, do you have anything to say

310
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:58,464
任何内容  你知道
That has anything to do with, you know,

311
00:14:58,474 --> 00:15:00,184
只要和我在说的有关的
What I'm talking about?

312
00:15:00,804 --> 00:15:02,264
好  让我想想
Well, let's see...

313
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:05,494
我们也许可以参考"薛定谔猫"
We might cononsider schrodinger's cat.

314
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,294
薛定谔
Schrodinger?

315
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:08,584
是住2楼A座的那个女人吗
Is that the woman in 2a?

316
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:10,064
不  那位是格洛辛格女士
No, that's mrs. grossinger.

317
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:12,174
并且她不养猫  她养的是一只墨西哥无毛犬
And she doesn't have a cat, she has a mexican hairless.

318
00:15:12,184 --> 00:15:13,694
超烦人的一种小动物
Annoying little animal. yip, yip, yip, yip.

319
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,224
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

320
00:15:16,424 --> 00:15:17,804
对不起  你又让我跑题了
Sorry, you diverted me.

321
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:21,624
在1935年  埃尔文・薛定谔
Anyway, in 1935, erwin schrodinger,

322
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:24,054
尝试去说明在量子物理学中的
In an attempt to explain the copenhagen interpretation

323
00:15:24,064 --> 00:15:24,994
哥本哈根解释
Of quantum physics,

324
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:26,324
他做了个实验
He proposed an experimen

325
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:30,234
把一只猫和一小瓶密封好的毒药一起放在盒子里
Where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison

326
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:32,134
毒药瓶随时会破裂
That will break open at a random time.

327
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:33,964
好  除非你打开盒子
Now, since no one knows when

328
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,064
不然没人知道毒药是否
Or if the poison has been released,

329
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:37,664
或者是何时已经被释放了
Until the box is opened,

330
00:15:37,674 --> 00:15:41,924
因此我们认为猫或活或死都是可以的
The cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.

331
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:48,594
对不起  我没听明白
I'm sorry. I don't get the point.

332
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:50,984
你当然不会明白  我还没说呢
Wellofof course you don't get it; I haven't made it yet.

333
00:15:52,884 --> 00:15:54,174
你只有靠第六感才能明白了
You'd have to be psychic to get it,

334
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,354
而事实是根本就没有"第六感"这个东西
And there's no such thing as "psychic."

335
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:56,774
谢尔顿  你到底想说什么?
Sheldon, what's the point?!

336
00:15:57,094 --> 00:15:58,904
就好像"薛定谔猫"
Just like schrodinger's cat,

337
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:01,594
现在你和莱纳德潜在的可能
Your potential relationship with leonard right now

338
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:03,944
既可以被认为是美好的也可以是不好的
Can be thought of as both good andadad.

339
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:05,694
只有当你打开盒子
It is only by opening the box

340
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,384
你才知道到底是哪一种
That you'll find out which it is.

341
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,514
明白了  你是说我应该先跟莱纳德处处看
Okay, so you're saying I should go out with leonard.

342
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:13,284
不不  不不
No, no, no, no, no.

343
00:16:15,094 --> 00:16:16,044
我再说一遍吧
Let me start again.

344
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:18,614
在1935年  埃尔文・薛定谔...
In 1935, erwin schrodinger...

345
00:16:20,694 --> 00:16:21,954
那儿有俩座
Two seats right there.

346
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:26,794
长寿石灰?
社会主义万岁

347
00:16:28,744 --> 00:16:30,044
谢谢
Shay shay.

348
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,194
谢尔顿  我想我办错了件事
Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.

349
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,234
我知道
I can seththat.

350
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:38,894
除非你是在备战马拉松
Unless you're planning on running a marathon,

351
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:40,724
不然填塞陷儿和土豆泥都要
Choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes

352
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,454
简直就是淀粉摄入过量
Is a starch-filled redundancy.

353
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:45,214
不  是关于佩妮的
No, it's about penny.

354
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:47,204
关于佩妮的错误
A mistake involving penny.

355
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:49,474
好吧  我得缩小范围了
Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.

356
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,204
我觉得今天晚上我不能跟她去约会
I don't think I can go out with her tonight.

357
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:54,164
那就别去
Then don't.

358
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:57,194
别人一般会说"为什么不去"
Other pelele would say "why not?"

359
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:58,934
别人可能比较感兴趣
Other people might be interested.

360
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:02,194
反正我还是要说
I'm going to talk anyway.

361
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:03,454
我猜你也是
I assumed you would.

362
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:07,074
现在我真的要和佩妮去约会了
Now that I'm actually about to go out with penny,

363
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:09,804
我反而并不激动  我反胃
I'm not excited--i'm nauseous.

364
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:11,734
那你的食物就是选对了
Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate.

365
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:14,694
淀粉能吸收对于呕吐起作用的
Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit

366
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:16,374
催吐物质
Available for violent expulsion.

367
00:17:17,364 --> 00:17:18,614
-好吧  -你还犯了
Right. you also made

368
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:19,894
一个文法上的错误
A common grammatical mistake.

369
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:22,384
你说的是"反胃的"  其实你想说"让人作呕的"
You said "nauseous," when you meant "nauseated."

370
00:17:23,464 --> 00:17:24,414
你接着说
But go on.

371
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:28,354
谢尔顿  这次约会很可能就是我唯一的机会
Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with penny.

372
00:17:28,364 --> 00:17:30,004
我如果搞砸了怎么办?
What happens if I blow it?

373
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:32,554
好  假设我们按你说的前提
Well, if we accept your premise

374
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:35,224
并且承认佩妮就是上帝安排给你的另一半
And also accept the highly improbable assumption

375
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,404
这个极不可能的假设
That penny is the only woman in the world for you,

376
00:17:37,414 --> 00:17:39,554
那我们从逻辑上可以得出的结论是
Then we can logically conclude that the result

377
00:17:39,564 --> 00:17:41,624
如果你搞砸这次约会  后果就是
Of blowing it would  be that you end up

378
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:44,114
你将会孤独  辛酸地终老  并且没有后代
A lonely, bitter old man with no progeny.

379
00:17:44,254 --> 00:17:46,424
我脑中突然浮现了史酷比动画片里
The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers

380
00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:48,474
一群邪恶的灯塔管理员的画面
From scooby-doo cartoons comes to mind.

381
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:50,944
你这是在捣乱
You're not helping.

382
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:53,224
好吧  我怎么回答你
All right, what respon on my part

383
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,654
才能赶紧结束这个话题呢?
Would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?

384
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:58,324
你就告诉我该不该去赴约
Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.

385
00:17:58,334 --> 00:17:59,924
薛定谔猫
Scododinger's cat.

386
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,274
太聪明了
Wow,that's brilliant.

387
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:05,214
你听起来很吃惊啊
You sound surprised.

388
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:12,124
猴子睡在里头
好滋味在里头..

389
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:28,274
好啊
Hi.

390
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:29,314
好
Hi.

391
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:30,664
进来
Come on in.

392
00:18:30,774 --> 00:18:31,804
谢谢
Thank you.

393
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:34,934
你真漂亮
You look very nice.

394
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:37,234
谢谢  你也是
Thank you. so do you.

395
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:42,814
我定了座位  8点
I made an 8:00 reservation.

396
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,034
好啊  太好了
Okay, yeah, great.

397
00:18:44,044 --> 00:18:45,204
听着
Listen, um...

398
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:47,424
也许我们应该先谈谈
Maybe we should talk first.

399
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:50,454
好
Okay.

400
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:53,304
但是在你说之前
But before you say anything,

401
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:55,764
你听说过薛定谔猫吗
Have you ever heard of schrodinger's cat?

402
00:18:58,294 --> 00:19:01,514
事实上  我听过太多薛定谔猫了
Actually, I've heard far too much about schrodinger's cat.

403
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:03,984
好
Good.

404
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,464
好啦  看来猫还是活的
All right, the cat's alive.

405
00:19:11,474 --> 00:19:12,644
我们去吃饭吧
L's go to dinner.

406
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:20,672
鼻涕在哪儿  鼻涕
Bee ti tsai nar! bee ti!

407
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:24,222
擤干净鼻涕  快走快走
Xing gan jing bi ti hou quai zoui.

408
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:26,522
