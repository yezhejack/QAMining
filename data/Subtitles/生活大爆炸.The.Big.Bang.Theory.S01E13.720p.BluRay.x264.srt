1
00:00:02,652 --> 00:00:05,082
"星舰迷航"有新的内幕消息说
New more details about the new star trek film.

2
00:00:05,442 --> 00:00:08,972
会有描写史巴克出生的镜头
There's going to be a scene depicting spock's birth.

3
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:10,362
我还是对描写
I'd be more interested

4
00:00:10,362 --> 00:00:12,442
史巴克是如何被怀上的镜头更感兴趣
In a scene depicting spock's conception.

5
00:00:10,362 --> 00:00:12,442
“星舰迷航”主人公之一 是Vulcan族

6
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:14,812
算了吧
Oh, please.

7
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:18,582
对于瓦肯人  交配  或者你可以说"pon fahr"...
For vulcans, mating-- or if you will, pon fahr--

8
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:18,582
瓦肯人是 "星舰"系列中的瓦肯星人形生物  Pon farr 瓦肯人七年一次的发情期

9
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:21,232
这是超隐私的事情
It's an extremely private matter.

10
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:23,122
但我还是想知道细节
Still, I'd like to know the details.

11
00:00:23,172 --> 00:00:24,232
他母亲是个人类
His mother was human.

12
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,042
他父亲是个瓦肯人
His father is vulcan.

13
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:26,162
他们不能随便就怀上了
They couldn't just conceive.

14
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:27,742
也许他们得去个诊所
Maybe they had to go to a clinic.

15
00:00:27,742 --> 00:00:29,532
想象下史巴克的父亲身处一个小屋
Can you imagine spock's dad in a little room

16
00:00:29,532 --> 00:00:32,572
里面全是长着尖耳和肥臀的怪物
With a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.

17
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:35,192
怎么在星舰迷航里
How come on star trek

18
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:36,872
每个人的私密部位都长得一样啊?
Everybody's private parts are the same?

19
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:39,622
没有哪一个外星妞对柯克舰长(男主角)说过
No alien lady ever told captain kirk,

20
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,462
"把你那玩意从我鼻孔里拔出来"
"hey, get your thing out of my nose."

21
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:45,752
你们好  能不能帮帮忙?
Hi. can you help me?

22
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:48,112
我正在写电子邮件  然后a键坏了
I was writing an e-mail and the "a" key got stuck.

23
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:49,792
现在一按就"aaa..."
Now it's just going "aaa..."

24
00:00:51,162 --> 00:00:52,572
什么东西洒上面了?
What'd you spill on it?

25
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:53,642
没啊
Nothing.

26
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:55,222
健怡可乐
Diet coke.

27
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,002
还有酸奶
And yogurt.

28
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:00,352
还有点指甲油
And a little nail polish.

29
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:01,852
我先看看吧
I'll take a look at it.

30
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:05,362
先生们  请注意本地书呆子新闻
Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news--

31
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:08,502
今年的大学物理碗比赛  渔夫  陈  肖杜里和麦克奈
Fishman, chen, chaudury and mcnair aren't fielding a team

32
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,172
不打算组队参加了
In the university physics bowl this year.

33
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:11,482
不会吧  为什么啊
You're kidding. why not?

34
00:01:11,482 --> 00:01:14,282
他们成立了一个理发店轻唱组
They formed a barbershop quartet and got a gig

35
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,172
并将在诺氏果园表演
Playing knott's berry farm.

36
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,172
南加州一主题公园

37
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:19,322
这么说在你们的圈子里
Wow, so in your world

38
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,312
你们已经算是潮人了
You're like the cool guys.

39
00:01:22,652 --> 00:01:23,962
正解
Recognize.

40
00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:27,412
今年我们赢定了
This is our year.

41
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:29,442
那些家伙不参加  整个物理碗
With those guys out, the entire physics bowl

42
00:01:29,442 --> 00:01:30,872
就将跪倒臣服于扎德了
Will kneel before zod.

43
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:32,012
扎德?
Zod?

44
00:01:32,012 --> 00:01:33,962
超人里的一个大反派  说来话长
Kryptonian villain. long story.

45
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:35,042
挺有趣的
Good story.

46
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:39,912
我可不去
Well, count me out.

47
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:41,262
什么  为什么
What? why?

48
00:01:41,262 --> 00:01:42,922
你们想利用我的聪明才智
You want me to use my intelligence

49
00:01:42,922 --> 00:01:44,532
去参加那么庸俗的比赛?
In a tawdry competition?

50
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:45,522
你会叫毕加索
Would you ask

51
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,262
去玩看图猜字吗
Picasso to play pictionary?

52
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:50,632
你会叫韦伯斯特(词典编纂者)去玩猜字游戏吗
Would you ask noah webster to play boggle?

53
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:54,482
Noah Webster 美国词典编纂之父  Jacques Cousteau 法国海军将领 海洋生物学家

54
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,482
你会叫雅克・库斯托(知名潜水家)去玩钓鱼?
Would you ask jacques cousteau to play go fish?

55
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:57,922
别这样  你需要一个四人团队
Come on, you need a four-person team.

56
00:01:57,922 --> 00:01:59,052
我们正好四个人
We're four people.

57
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,552
照你这么说  我们还得玩桥牌
By that reasoning we should also

58
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:02,352
举着一个天蓬
Play bridge, hold up a chuppah

59
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:04,452
去参加奥林匹克雪车速滑赛
And enter the olympic bobsled competition.

60
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,402
别忘了给我弄张票
Tickets to that, please.

61
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:10,292
谢尔顿  你什么意思  需要我引用
Sheldon, what, do I need to quote

62
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,292
史巴克临死前的一席话吗
Spock's dying words to you?

63
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:16,292
美国儿科专家 教育家和作家

64
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:13,272
别  不要
No, don't.

65
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:15,992
"...重于少数人的利益
"the needs of the many...

66
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:18,232
"...少数人的需求要重要
"...outweigh the needs of the few.

67
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:19,662
...或个人的利益"
...or the one."

68
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:21,722
该死  我去吧
Damn it, I'll do it.

69
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:44,484
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第13集
The.Bat.Jar.Conjecture

70
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,337
参加物理碗比赛的头等大事儿
Okay, first order of physics bowl business

71
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:53,927
就是我们得起个拉风的队名
We need a truly kick-ass team name.

72
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:55,307
有什么想法没?
Suggestions?

73
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:58,167
叫永动机队怎么样?
How about the perpetual motion squad?

74
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:00,797
它超越了物理学的理论
It's beyond the laws of physics, plus

75
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:02,617
而且对女士们也是一种暗示
A little heads-up for the ladies.

76
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:04,697
女士们?
The ladies?

77
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:07,707
"永动机队...我们可以干一整夜"
"perpetual motion squad-- we can go all night."

78
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:09,477
我喜欢
I like it.

79
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:10,557
我不喜欢
I don't.

80
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:13,477
按照传统  一般都是以凶猛的动物取名
Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures,

81
00:03:13,477 --> 00:03:15,577
以此来威慑对手
Thus intimidating one's opponent.

82
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:17,507
那我们应该叫孟加拉虎队
Then we could be the bengal tigers.

83
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:18,457
太垃圾了
Poor choice.

84
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:19,687
从合力来说
Gram for gram,

85
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:21,897
没有动物可以强过
No animal exceeds the relative fighting strength

86
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,067
热带行军蚁群
Of the army ant.

87
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:25,337
也许是吧
Maybe so,

88
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:27,097
但是你用放大镜
But you can't incinerate a bengal tiger

89
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:28,357
没法把孟加拉虎点着
With a magnifying glass.

90
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:33,477
我们还是投票吧
Let's put it to a vote.

91
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:35,057
-喜欢...  -你先等等
All those in favor... point of order.

92
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:36,677
我觉得团队的名字
I move that any vote on team names

93
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:37,877
需要意见完全统一
Must be unanimous.

94
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:39,717
你们不能在按常理
No man should be forced to emblazon his chest

95
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:41,807
都会选择热带行军蚁群的情况下
With a bengal tiger when common sense dictates

96
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:43,187
强制别人在胸口印一只孟加拉虎
It should be an army ant.

97
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:45,937
这位从不接受别人意见的绅士
Will the gentleman from the great state of denial

98
00:03:45,937 --> 00:03:47,207
愿意屈服一次吗
Yield for a question?

99
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:49,377
我会屈服
I will yield.

100
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:51,087
当我们经过这
After we go through the exercise

101
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:52,667
无聊烦人的投票之后
Of an annoying series of votes,

102
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,097
这位绅士肯定会输
All of which the gentleman will lose,

103
00:03:54,097 --> 00:03:55,597
然后当不能按照他的方式来
Does he then intend to threaten to quit

104
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:57,247
-他是否就要用退出来威胁大家?  -他会的
If he does not get his way? he does.

105
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:59,777
我同意热带行军蚁群  你们呢?
I move we are the army ants. all those in favor?

106
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:04,357
下午好  欢迎你们
Good afternoon, and welcome

107
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:06,497
来到今天的物理碗大赛练习赛
To today's physics bowl practice round.

108
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,497
我叫佩妮  将担任主持人
I'm penny, and I'll be your host

109
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:10,567
因为很明显  我周六下午
Because apparently I didn't have anything else to do

110
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:11,847
也没什么其它的事儿干
On a saturday afternoon,

111
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:14,337
这是不是有点悲哀?
And isn't that just a little sad?

112
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,457
先生们  准备好了吗
Gentlemen, are you ready?

113
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,017
-当然  -快开始吧
Yes. of course. fire away.

114
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:20,557
这可能不关我的事
You know, it's none of my business,

115
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:21,777
但有个男人在女人面前都不说话
But isn't a guy who can't speak

116
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:23,827
会不会让你们感觉有些自信心不足?
In front of women going to hold you back a little?

117
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:25,037
只要女人待在人群里
Oh, he'll be okay

118
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:26,507
他就应该没事儿
Once the women are mixed into the crowd.

119
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:28,277
只有当跟女人一对一并且那人闻起来很香时
He only has a problem when they're one-on-one

120
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:29,377
他才会出问题
And smell nice.

121
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:32,567
谢了  拉杰  是香草味的油
Ah, thanks, raj. it's vanilla oil.

122
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,607
其实我才是那个注意到的人
I was actually the one who noticed.

123
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,787
好的  开始吧
Okay, let's just start.

124

126
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:41,867
有史以来最短的光脉冲是多少?
"what is the shortest light pulse ever produced?"

127
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:43,337
库珀博士
Dr. cooper.

128
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:46,217
毫无疑问  答案是130百亿亿分之一秒
And of course the answer is 130 attoseconds.

129
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:47,987
-回答正确  -我也知道的
That is correct. I knew that, too.

130
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:50,117
你真棒  亲爱的
Good for you, sweetie.

131
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:52,027
好了  下个问题

133
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:56,497
被应用在硬盘存储加密上?
"used to encode data on hard-disk drives?"

134
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:57,647
霍华德
Howard?

135
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:58,977
毫无疑问  答案是
And of course the answer is

136
00:04:58,977 --> 00:05:00,997
-巨磁阻  -正确
Giant magnetoresistance. right.

137
00:05:00,997 --> 00:05:02,277
我先抢到的
Hey, I buzzed in.

138
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:04,627
然后我回答了  这叫团队合作
And I answered. it's called teamwork.

139
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,217
你难道不觉得应该
Don't you think I should answer

140
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:10,927
由我来回答工程问题吗  我是个工程师
The engineering questions? I am an engineer.

141
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,247
照这个逻辑  那我应该回答
By that logic I should answer

142
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:14,677
所有人类学的问题  因为我是哺乳动物
All the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal.

143
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:19,317
问下一题吧
Just ask another one.

144
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:20,497
好的
Okay.

145
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:23,157
哪颗人造卫星记录下了
"what artificial satellite has seen glimpses

146
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,177
爱因斯坦预言的时空结构拖曳现象?
Of einstein's predicted frame dragging?"

147
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:28,117
致密天体 例如黑洞与中子星 它们的自转能吸引附近的空间与时间 围绕它们一同转
2004年发射升空 任务是探测地球附近的时空曲率

148
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,117
答案是引力探测器B卫星
And of course, it's gravity probe b.

149
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:29,727
谢尔顿
Sheldon,

150
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,577
你得让其他人也参与答题
You have to let somebody else answer.

151
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:32,417
为什么
Why?

152
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,107
因为这是礼貌
Because it's polite.

153
00:05:34,407 --> 00:05:36,257
这跟礼貌有什么关系
What do manners have to do with it?

154
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:37,727
这是战争
This is war.

155
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:40,837
当罗马人在迦太基(北非一古城)地上撒盐
Were the romans polite when they salted the ground

156
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,827
确保以后寸草不生的时候他们讲礼貌了吗
Of carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?

157
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:46,517
莱纳德  你说过我只负责提问的
Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.

158
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:51,597
竞赛的目的就是为了给出正确答案
The objective of the competition is to give correct answers.

159
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:53,717
如果我知道  我为什么不说出来
If I know them, why shouldn't I give them?

160
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:56,407
因为也许我们也知道正确答案
Some of us might have the correct answers, too.

161
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:58,777
别逗了  你连博士学位都没有
Oh, please. you don't even have a phd.

162
00:05:58,777 --> 00:05:59,517
好吧  够了!
All right, that's it!

163
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:01,247
-霍华德  坐下  -好吧
Howard, sit down. okay.

164
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:04,777
也许我们需要稍微休息一下
Maybe we should take a little break.

165
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:06,507
好主意  我得活动下腕关节
Good idea. I need my wrist brace.

166
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:07,737
按这些键弄得我以前
All this button-pushing

167
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:09,807
玩任天堂留下的老伤更严重了
Is aggravating my old nintendo injury.

168
00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:11,997
我同意
I agree.

169
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:13,487
他说什么
What did he say?

170
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:15,427
他把谢尔顿比喻成
He compared sheldon

171
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:18,697
某种可能会在夏夜用到的
To a disposable feminine cleansing product

172
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:20,747
"夏依"女性清洁用品
One might use on a summer's eve.

173
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,227
没错  还有那进来的套套
Yeah, and the bag it came in.

174
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:31,037
莱纳德  太好了
Leonard, excellent.

175
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:32,347
我想给你看样东西
I want to show you something.

176
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:34,167
等等行吗  我想跟你谈谈
Can it wait? I need to talk to you.

177
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:34,797
快看
Just look.

178
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:37,287
我刚为我们队设计了一款完美的队服
I've designed the perfect uniforms for our team.

179
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:40,207
颜色是基于"星际旅行"原始系列
The colors are based on star trek the original series.

180
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:41,927
你们三个穿上陪衬的红色
The three of you will wear support red,

181
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:43,837
我穿象征命令的金色
And I will wear command gold.

182
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:47,167
"AA"是什么意思?
Why do they say "aa"?

183
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:48,897
行军蚁
Army ants.

184
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:51,437
会不会容易产生歧义?
Isn't that confusing?

185
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:52,497
AA对某些人
"aa" might mean

186
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:53,987
可能表示其它的什么意思
Something else to certain people.

187
00:06:54,907 --> 00:06:56,077
为什么一支物理碗比赛队
Why would a physics bowl team

188
00:06:56,077 --> 00:06:57,917
会起名为阳极氧化铝呢
Be called anodized aluminum?

189
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:00,607
不  我是指...
No, I meant...

190
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:02,377
算了
Never mind.

191
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:04,597
来看看这个
Hey, check it out,

192
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:08,757
我给你买了个蝙蝠侠饼干罐
I got you a batman cookie jar.

193
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:10,157
太帕
Oh, neat!

194
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:11,547
什么节日啊
What's the occasion?

195
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:14,197
朋友嘛  你又喜欢蝙蝠侠
Well, you're a friend, and you like batman

196
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:16,537
还有饼干  你被剔除出队了
And cookies, and you're off the team.

197
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:20,947
什么?
What?

198
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:23,627
霍华德  拉杰和我刚开了个团队会议
Howard, raj and I just had a team meeting.

199
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:26,317
-不  你们没开  -是  我们确实开了  我刚从那回来
No, you didn't. yes, we did. I just came from there.

200
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:28,297
好吧  不管你从哪里回来
Okay, I don't know where you just came from,

201
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:29,927
但是你们不可能开团队会议的
But it could not have have been a team meeting

202
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,637
因为我也是队员  并且我不在场
Because I'm on the team and I wasn't there.

203
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:33,587
因此  这个队并没有会
Ergo, the team did not meet.

204
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:36,187
好吧  我这么说吧
OK. let me try it this way.

205
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:40,187
我跟几个朋友一起喝了杯咖啡聊了聊
I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends,

206
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:41,427
然后由一件事谈到了另一件
And one thing led to another,

207
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,087
最后你就被剔除出队了
And it turns out you're off the team.

208
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:45,737
为什么啊?
Why?

209
00:07:45,737 --> 00:07:48,227
因为你弄得大家都没有兴致了
Because you're taking all the fun out of it.

210
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:49,157
抱歉
I'm sorry,

211
00:07:49,157 --> 00:07:50,437
难道物理碗的获胜者
Is the winner of the physics bowl

212
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,167
是最有兴致的那支队伍?
The team that has the most fun?

213
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,057
好吧  我这么说吧
OK. let me try it this way.

214
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:54,857
你太招人烦了
You're annoying

215
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:56,777
没人愿意再跟你合作了
And no one wants to play with you anymore.

216
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,437
我知道了
I see.

217
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:04,857
这么说那我得通知你下
Well, at this point I should inform you

218
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:07,647
我打算组建自己的队伍
That I intend to form my own team

219
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,567
然后把组成你们的
And destroy the molecular bonds

220
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,187
一切分子键弄得粉碎
That bind your very matter together

221
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:14,327
把形成的胡乱状态的粒子全都变成你们的眼泪
And reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.

222
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:18,397
多谢提醒
Thanks for the heads-up.

223
00:08:19,537 --> 00:08:20,577
不用谢
You're welcome.

224
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:23,647
-还有一件事  -什么?
One more thing. yes?

225
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:24,647
放马过来吧  婊子
It's on . B.I.T.C.H.

226
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:36,027
谁会跟他一组参赛呢
So who'd he get to be on his team?

227
00:08:36,177 --> 00:08:37,237
他不说
He won't say.

228
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:40,437
他只是笑着从他的蝙蝠侠罐里拿蛋白杏仁饼干吃
He just smiles and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.

229
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,727
他在跟你打心理战
He's using psychological warfare.

230
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,517
我们必须以牙还牙
We must reply in kind.

231
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:47,607
我是说等他看咱们的时候
I say we wait until he looks at us,

232
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:51,357
咱们也笑  好像在说"是  你是个聪明强大的对手"
Then laugh like, "yes, you are a smart and strong competitor,

233
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:53,187
"但我们也一样"
"but we are also smart and strong,

234
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:55,527
"我们非常有可能击败你"
And we have a reasonable chance of defeating you."

235
00:08:57,897 --> 00:08:59,887
那我们到底该怎么笑呢
How exactly would that laugh go?

236
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:07,067
这听起来更像是  "我们是一个
That sounds more like, "we are a tall,

237
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:10,677
"101忠狗"中的邪恶女老板

238
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:10,677
想拨了你的达尔马提亚狗皮做大衣的瘦高个女人"
Thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your dalmatians."

239
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:13,897
哥几个别忘了
Guys, let's remember

240
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:16,437
谢尔顿毕竟还是我们的朋友和我的室友
That sheldon is still our friend and my roommate.

241
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:17,457
那怎么了?
So?

242
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,037
没事
So nothing.

243
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:20,087
让我们整垮他吧
Let's destroy him.

244
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,567
先生们
Gentlemen.

245
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,417
我们得赶紧找一个最佳第四人
Okay, we're going to need a strong fourth for our team.

246
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:34,967
你们知道谁一看就很聪明吗
You know who is apparently very smart

247
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,817
我觉得演Blossom的那个女孩很聪明
Is the girl who played tv's blossom.

248
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:41,187
她有博士学位  神经学科或者其它什么
She got a phd. in neuroscience or something.

249
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:43,617
拉杰  我们不能让情景喜剧演员
Raj, we're not getting tv's blossom

250
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,457
加入我们的物理碗比赛队的
To join our physics bowl team.

251
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:48,807
那个主演"纯真年代"的女孩怎么样
How about the girl from the wonder years?

252
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:53,437
先生们  我相信我找到可以解决
Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution

253
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:55,267
所有问题的办法了
To all our problems.

254
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:59,147
我们不能去找莱斯利・温克
We can't ask leslie winkle.

255
00:09:59,147 --> 00:10:00,937
为什么?  就因为你和她睡过
Why? because you slept together,

256
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:01,857
而当她和你做完后
And when she was done with you

257
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:03,877
把你像隔夜的酸辣酱那样扔了?
She discarded you like last night's chutney?

258
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:09,357
是
Yes.

259
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:12,527
有时为了团队必须得牺牲个人
Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.

260
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,427
是啊  有点男人样  伙计
Yeah, sack up, dude.

261
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,277
好吧
Fine.

262
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:21,297
我去  为了团队牺牲自己...
Here I go, taking one for the team...

263
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:22,577
男人
In the sack.

264
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:26,757
好  莱斯利
Hey, leslie.

265
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:28,157
你们好
Hi, guys.

266
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:30,577
莱斯利  我有个问题问你
So, leslie, I have a question for you,

267
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:31,577
可能会
And it might be

268
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:34,577
有些尴尬  考虑到我...
A little awkward, you know, given that i...

269
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:36,387
干过你
Hit that thang.

270
00:10:39,757 --> 00:10:42,007
莱纳德  没有任何理由只因为我们
Leonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable

271
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:43,777
看过彼此在极度激动的快感下
Just because we've seen each other's faces

272
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,967
那扭曲的脸和裸体就感到有什么尴尬的
And naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus.

273
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:49,757
没有吗
There's not?

274
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:52,557
天  听上去肯定应该很尴尬才是
Gee, 'cause it sure sounds like there should be.

275
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:56,057
放心  我们性生活的任何内容
Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship

276
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:57,527
包括你的喜好
Regarding your preferences,

277
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:59,507
你的手法  你的表现
Your idiosyncrasies, your performance
