1
00:00:02,986 --> 00:00:03,936
好
Okay...

2
00:00:05,396 --> 00:00:07,516
X-10(先进网络技术)已经联网了
The x-tens are online.

3
00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:10,646
先生们  我现在要通过这台电脑发射一个信号		
Gentlemen, I am now about send a signal

4
00:00:10,646 --> 00:00:13,506
连接到我们当地的互联网服务供应商
From this laptop through our local isp

5
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:16,356
以光速在光纤电缆中传输到旧金山  
Racing down fiber-optic cable at the speed of light

6
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:18,666
再通过地球同步轨道卫星
To san francisco, bouncing off a satellite

7
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,866
反射到葡萄牙的里斯本
In geosynchronous orbit to lisbon, portugal,

8
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:21,996
在那里数据将
Where the data packets

9
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:23,816
切换到跨大西洋海底电缆
Will be handed off to submerged trans-atlantic cables

10
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,806
最终汇聚到加拿大新斯科舍省的哈里法克斯  
Terminating in halifax, nova scotia

11
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:27,186
再通过微波中继跨越整个大陆
And transferred across the continent

12
00:00:27,186 --> 00:00:29,376
最后回到我们的互联网服务供应商
Via microwave relays back to our isp

13
00:00:29,376 --> 00:00:31,476
而X-10的接收器就连接着这个...
And the x-ten receiver attached to this...

14
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:34,576
灯
Lamp.

15
00:00:37,276 --> 00:00:39,286
快看  快看  我鸡皮疙瘩都起来了
Look at me. look at me. I've got goose bumps.

16
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:41,166
我们试试音响  准备好了没
Are we ready on the stereo?

17
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:42,326
快试试音响
Go for stereo.

18
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:04,716
伙计们
Hey, guys.

19
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:06,226
-你好  -你好
Hi. hello. hello.

20
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,156
声音有点大
It's a little loud.

21
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,456
没问题  马上关小它
No problem-- turning it down.

22
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:14,226
旧金山  里斯本  哈里法克斯
San francisco, lisbon, halifax...

23
00:01:14,236 --> 00:01:15,826
瞧  好了吧(法语)
And voila.

24
00:01:15,836 --> 00:01:16,866
好  谢了
Okay, thanks.

25
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,696
等等  等等  你是不是没明白我们在干什么
Hang on, hang on. do you not realize what we just did?

26
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,296
明白  你们用电脑把音响关小了
Yeah, you turned your stereo down with you laptop.

27
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:25,296
不是  我们通过互联网走了地球一圈
No, we turned our stereo down by sending a snall

28
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:27,866
发送了一个命令把音响关小的
Around the world via the internet.

29
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:30,156
其实这样一个遥控装置
You know, you can just get one of those universal remotes

30
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,506
在瑞帝优上(美国电子产品零售企业)里有买  而且很便宜
At radio shack. they're really cheap.

31
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:34,526
不  不  你还是没明白
No, no. You don't get it.

32
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:37,096
霍华德  开启公共接入功能
Howard, enable public access.

33
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:38,766
公共接入已开启
Public access enabled.

34
00:01:41,706 --> 00:01:43,866
真不赖  伙计们  我先走了
Boy, that's terrific. I'll see ya.

35
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,376
别  等等  等等
No, hang on, hang on.

36
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:49,936
看到没?
See?

37
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:51,846
没有
No.

38
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:54,526
在中国四川省的某个人
Someone in szechwan province, china

39
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:55,686
正在通过他的电脑
is using his computer

40
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:57,716
远程开关我们的灯
To turn our lights on and off.

41
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:00,916
那倒是很方便
Well, that's handy.

42
00:02:02,226 --> 00:02:04,446
我提个问题  为什么要做这个?
Here is the question. Why?

43
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,506
因为我们可以做到
Because we can.

44
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,546
他们发现了远程遥控汽车
They found the remote-control cars.

45
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:14,966
等等  等等  车顶上是什么?
Well, wait, wait, what's on top of that?

46
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:17,526
无线网络摄像头  打个招呼
Wireless web cams. wave hello.

47
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:20,606
那辆大货车来自德克萨斯州的奥斯丁  
The monster truck is out of austin, texas,

48
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:22,496
而"蓝毒蛇"正在被一个来自
And the blue viper is being operated

49
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:24,726
以色列特拉维夫郊区的人控制
From suburban tel aviv.

50
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:28,786
你也许应该穿条裤子
You may want to put on slacks.

51
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:30,396
什么
What?

52
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:33,476
快停下来
Ew, stop it.

53
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,026
不  离我远点
No leave me alone

54
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:40,196
那个红色雪佛兰是谁控制的?
Who's running the red corvette?

55
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:41,936
是我
That would be me.

56
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:03,316
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第09集
The.Cooper.Hofstadter.Polarization

57
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,660
你们知道吗  在将来
You know, in the future

58
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,930
当我们能把大脑取出来放到罐子里时
When we're disembodied brains in jars,

59
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,950
我们回过头看看这八小时  会觉得那真无聊
We're going to look back at this as eight hours well wasted.

60
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,980
我不想被放到罐子里
I don't want to be in a jar.

61
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,510
我想把我的大脑放在机器人身上
I want my brain in an android body.

62
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,660
最好身高八英尺  身材健美
Eight feet tall and ripped.

63
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,410
我支持你
I'm with you.

64
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,540
我只是要确保假使我成了合成人
I just have to make sure that if I'm a synthetic human,

65
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,870
我也还得是犹太人
I'd still be jewish.

66
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,200
我答应过我妈妈
I promised my mother.

67
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,840
我猜你还得给你那机器人鸡鸡做个包皮手术
I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised,

68
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,650
但那是你的犹太教主
But that's something

69
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,090
和机器人制造者需要讨论的问题
Your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer.

70
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,600
更不用说每到周六  你还得把电源关了
Not to mention you'd have to power down on saturdays.

71
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,970
谢尔顿  这信怎么在垃圾桶里?
Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?

72
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,790
在一封信旁边自动生成一只垃圾桶
Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can

73
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,180
是有可能出现的事情
Spontaneously formed around the letter,

74
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,230
但奥卡姆剃刀定律
But occam's razor

75
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,990
会认为是有人把它给扔了
Would suggest that someone threw it out.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,050
是实验物理研究院寄来的
It's from the institute for experimental physics.

77
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,950
他们希望我们能在
They want us to present our paper

78
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,650
主题为玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚的会议上
On the properties of supersolids

79
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,480
做我们超固体性质的论文演讲
At the topical conference on bose einstein condensates.

80
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,690
我知道  我扔之前看过
I know, I read it before I threw it out.

81
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,450
容许我把问题阐述地更清楚些
Okay, if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question

82
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,150
你为什么要扔了它呢
Why did you throw it out?

83
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,650
因为我没兴趣站在万豪国际酒店的
Because I have no interest in standing in the rose room

84
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,980
玫瑰间里
Of the Pasadena Marriott

85
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,320
去面对一群互相不认识但又喜欢评头论足的人
In front of a group of judgmental strangers

86
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,870
他们不会意识到
Who wouldn't recognize true genius

87
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,710
在他们面前做演讲的人是真正的天才
If it was standing in front of them giving a speech.

88
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,380
因为如果我在那  我会这么认为的
Which, if I were there, it would be.

89
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,700
我不知道  谢尔顿
I don't know, sheldon.

90
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,910
那些主题为玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚的会议
Those topical conference on bose einstein condensates

91
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,740
之后的庆功会都是超赞的
Parties are legendary.

92
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,220
别提那些庆功会
Forget the parties.

93
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,490
别提那些庆功会?  你个白痴
Forget the parties? what a nerd.

94
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,850
还有什么别的荣誉我不知道的吗
Are there any other honors I've gotten that I don't know about?

95
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,290
UPS有没有快递过
Did ups drop off a nobel prize

96
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,950
给我的诺贝尔奖?
With my name on it?

97
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,590
莱纳德  你千万别误会  
Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way,

98
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,120
不过你得诺贝尔奖的那天
But the day you win a nobel prize

99
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,050
就是我开始研究
Is the day I begin my research

100
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,430
阿拉伯飞毯上那些穗状雄花图案的风阻系数的那天
On the drag coefficient of tassels on flying carpets.

101
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,720
刚才那些侮辱中
Ooh, the only thing missing

102
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,240
唯一没有提到的就是"你妈妈"
From that insult was "your mama."

103
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,610
我补充一个
I got one.

104
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,220
莱纳德  你妈妈的研究方法问题实在太多...
Hey, leonard, your mama's research methodology is so flawed...

105
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,460
闭嘴  霍华德
Shut up, howard.

106
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,020
谢尔顿  我们得去参加这个
Sheldon, we have to do this.

107
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,320
不  我们不
No, we don't.

108
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,620
我们得吸取营养  排除毒素
We have to take in nourishment, expel waste,

109
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,090
并且吸入足够的氧气来维持我们细胞鲜活
And inhale enough oxygen to keep our cells from dying.

110
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,250
其它任何事都不是必须的
Everything else is optional.

111
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,890
好  那我这么说吧  我要去参加
Okay, let me put it this way, I'm doing it.

112
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,850
你不能  我是第一作者
You can't. I'm the lead author.

113
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,290
别逗了  之所以你是第一作者
Come on, the only reason you're the lead author

114
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,020
是因为这是按名字字母排序的
Is because we went alphabetically.

115
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,820
是我让你这么认为的
I let you think we went alphabetically

116
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,220
好让你不用面对这一耻辱性的事实
To spare you the humiliation

117
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,790
那就是这篇论文是我想出来的
Of dealing with the fact that it was my idea.

118
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,550
不是我有意要说得那么直白
Not to put too fine a point on it,

119
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,450
但事实是  我在可怜你
But I was throwing you a bone.

120
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,420
不用谢
You're welcome.

121
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,750
慢着  这个假说的实验证明是我设计的
Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.

122
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,730
它根本就不用证明
It doesn't need proving.

123
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,820
这么说  整个学术界就会那么
So the entire scientific community

124
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,250
不加任何质疑地相信你的话?
Is just supposed to take your word?

125
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,150
不是会  是他们应该那样
They're not supposed to, but they should.

126
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,020
算了  我不管你说什么
All right, I don't care what you say,

127
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,220
我要去参加会议并展示我们的成果
I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings.

128
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,030
我不允许
And I forbid it.

129
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,680
你不允许?
You forbid it?

130
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,350
如果我没有因为我们的成果而得到好评  那没人可以
If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is.

131
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,090
-这么说你承认这是我们俩的成果?  -没有
So you admit that it's our work? no.

132
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,190
再说一遍  我是在可怜你
Once again, I'm throwing you a bone.

133
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,860
并且再说一遍  不用谢
And once again you are welcome.

134
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,500
不  他不会吧(模仿莱纳德)
Oh, no, he didn't

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,290
你和谢尔顿现在怎样了
So, how's it going with sheldon?

136
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,250
你们还是谁也不理谁吗
Are you guys still not talking to each other?

137
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,020
他不但还是不跟我说话
Not only is he still not talking to me,

138
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,220
还会这么瞪着你  并做这么个动作
But there's this thing he does where he stares at you

139
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,300
试图把你的脑子弄爆
And tries to get your brain to explode.

140
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,060
就像那种经典的高科技电影里的扫描器
You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie scanners.

141
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,470
这样...
Like... bzzz...

142
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,350
不说了
Never mind.

143
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,110
这件怎么样?
How about this one?

144
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,090
可以告诉别人说  我是物理学家  但我也是个有趣的人
It says, I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy.

145
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,700
我不知道现在还有做灯芯绒外套
Wow, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits.

146
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,320
是不做了  所以我才一直留着它
They don't.That's why I saved this one.

147
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,380
好吧  让我再看看
Okay, well, let's just see

148
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,270
你还有什么别的
What else you have.

149
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,320
拿着这个...
Okay, here, take this...

150
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,390
和这个  这个  还有这些...
And this, and this, and these...

151
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,220
所有这些你都要让我试穿?
Is this all stuff you want me to try on?

152
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,230
不  这些是我想让你扔了的
No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.

153
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,540
说真的  甚至不要把它们捐作慈善
Oh. seriously, don't even give them to charity.

154
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,640
你这不是在帮助任何人
You won't be helping anyone.

155
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,700
这是什么?
What's this?

156
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,500
这是坎多(对抗魔人的守卫国度)的瓶中城
That's the bottle city of kandor.

157
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,620
知道吗  坎多曾经是
You see, kandor was the capital city

158
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,920
克里顿星球(还是星球大战)的首都
Of the planet krypton.

159
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,390
它被天才在克里顿爆炸前缩小了
It was miniaturized by brainiac before krypton exploded,

160
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,760
然后被超人拯救了
And then rescued by superman.

161
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,250
不错
Oh. nice.

162
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,720
还是女孩子不看这些的时候比较好
It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.

163
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,080
你穿上这个试试
Here, why don't you put these on

164
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,710
我再看看有没有合适的T恤和运动外衣
While I find a shirt and a sport coat that match.

165
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,880
好  我马上回来
Great, I'll be right back.

166
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,990
你去哪里?  就这样换了
Where are you going? just put 'em on.

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,250
在这?
Here?

168
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,590
你还害羞啊?
Oh, are you shy?

169
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,790
没  我没害羞
No, I'm not shy.

170
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,050
别担心  我不会看的
Don't worry. I won't look.

171
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,050
我知道你不会看  你为什么要看
I know you won't look. why would you look?

172
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,490
这也没什么好看的...倒也不是...
There's nothing to see... well, not nothing...

173
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,290
亲爱的  把裤子穿上
Sweetie, put the pants on.

174
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,960
穿了穿了
Putting 'em on.

175
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,320
你跟谢尔顿在演讲这件事情上
So, you know, isn't there maybe some way

176
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,750
就没有互相妥协的余地吗
You and sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing?

177
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,040
不  没有
No, no.

178
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,720
科学家从不妥协
Scientists do not compromise.

179
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,650
我们的大脑被锻炼成就是把事实结合起来
Our minds are trained to synthesize facts

180
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,320
然后得出无可辩驳的结论
And come to inarguable conclusions.

181
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,230
更不用说  谢尔顿还是个怪胎
Not to mention, sheldon is bat-crap crazy.

182
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,720
这是什么?
What is this?

183
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,730
小心
Oh, careful.

184
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,350
那个是原版
That's my original series

185
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,130
太空堡垒卡拉狄加的飞行服
Battlestar galactica flight suit.

186
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,020
万圣节的时候你怎么没穿这个?
Oh, why didn't you wear it on halloween?

187
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,630
因为那不是制服  是件飞行服
Because it's not a costume. it's a flight suit.

188
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,200
好的  我继续找
Okay, all right, moving on.

189
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,550
羊毛针织花衬衫
Oh, wow, a paisley shirt.

190
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,130
它正好配我那件灯芯绒外套
Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.

191
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,490
如果你是说他们得呆在一个地方  那我同意
If you mean they should end up in the same place, then I agree.

192
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,730
这是你唯一的领带吗
Is this your only tie?

193
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,320
理论上  是的
Technically, yes.

194
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,420
但如果你仔细看
But if you'll notice...

195
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,330
会发现这是两面的
It's reversible.

196
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,850
所以可以当两条用
So it works as two.

197
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,690
亲爱的  我觉得它连一条都不算
Oh sweetie, I don't even think it works as one.

198
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,420
这就是你所有的衣服吗
Is this all your clothes?

199
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,890
对  从我八年级到现在所有的
Yup. everything since the eighth grade.

200
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,190
八...八年级?
The... the eighth grade?

201
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,530
我从那时起就不再长了
My last growth spurt.

202
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,920
那好  我想我们还是回到这套灯芯绒外套吧
Okay, well, I guess we're back to the corduroy suit.

203
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,630
好的
Great. yep.

204
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,620
我说了不行  扔一边去
I said no. put it down.

205
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,260
好啊  谢尔顿
Hey, sheldon.

206
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:15,748
你好  潘妮
Hello, penny.

207
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:18,088
有什么好东西吗
Get anything good?

208
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:23,388
最近一季度的应用粒子物理学报
Just the latest copy of applied particle physics quarterly.

209
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:27,418
真奇怪  怎么你的来了我的却没到
Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't.

210
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:34,588
我开玩笑呢
It was a joke.

211
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:41,538
给女服务生点小费
Yep, tip your waitresses.

212
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,558
我这一周都在
I'm here all week.

213
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:46,078
潘妮  为了避免你感觉更加尴尬
Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness,

214
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:48,148
如果我们两个安安静静地走上楼
Know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us

215
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:49,958
我完全没有意见
Climbing the stairs in silence.

216
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:51,178
是的  我也是
Oh, yeah, okay, me, too.

217
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:53,078
嘴巴拉上  闭紧
Zip it, lock it.

218
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:56,958
放在兜里
Put it in your pocket.

219
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:01,878
你和莱纳德
So, you and leonard.

220
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:03,558
天呐
Oh, dear god.

221
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:05,998
有点小误会  是吧
A little misunderstanding, huh?

222
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:07,688
有点小误...?
A little misundersta...?

223
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:11,658
伽利略和教皇之间是有点小误会
Galileo and the pope had a little misunderstanding.

224
00:10:14,408 --> 00:10:16,578
不管怎样  我今天早上跟莱纳德聊天
Anyway, I was talking to leonard this morning,

225
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:19,288
我认为他对于这事感到很难过
And I think he feels really bad about it.

226
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:22,678
你是什么感受
Well, how do you feel?

227
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,638
你没理解你这个问题
I don't understand the question.

228
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,878
不  我是问和最好的朋友发生争执
No, I'm just asking if it's difficult

229
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:30,108
是不是感觉很难受
To be fighting with your best friend.

230
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:33,108
我还没那么想过
Oh, I hadn't thought about it like that.

231
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:34,308
我在想我是否正在经受
I wonder if I've been experiencing

232
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:36,008
由于无意识感情上混乱
Physiological manifestations

233
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:39,458
而导致的一些生理表现
of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.

234
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:41,258
等等  什么?
Wait. what?

235
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:43,598
我今天早上拉不出屎
I couldn't poop this morning.

236
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:48,508
跟他说说话吧
Just talk to him.

237
00:10:48,518 --> 00:10:50,938
我想你们一定能把问题解决的
I'm sure you guys can work this out.

238
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:52,818
这肯定比我的计划更好
It's certainly preferable to my plan.

239
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:54,078
你什么计划?
Which was?

240
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:56,548
用强力泻药
A powerful laxative.

241
00:10:57,678 --> 00:10:59,868
好吧  你真的应该跟他好好谈谈
Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him.

242
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:01,448
我知道莱纳德把你当朋友的
Look, I know leonard values you as a friend,

243
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,548
他亲口告诉我  如果没有你那些小点子    
And he told me himself that without your little idea,

244
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:05,148
他就不可能
There's no way he could have

245
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:07,118
完成这整个实验
Come up with this whole experiment thing.

246
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:12,418
不好意思  "小点子"?
Excuse me. "little idea"?

247
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:14,178
我是说  他试着跟我解释过
Yeah, I mean, he tried to explain it to me.

248
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:15,208
我没有弄得很明白...
I didn't really understand it...

249
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:16,248
你当然没明白
Of course, you didn't.

250
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,378
他说"小点子"?
He said, "little idea"?

251
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:21,958
不  他不是那么说的
Well, no, not in... not in those words.

252
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:23,648
那是怎么说的  确切点
In what words then, exactly?

253
00:11:23,658 --> 00:11:25,308
天  确切的词是...
Um, you know, gee, the exact words...

254
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,878
他主要的意思是说...
It's more the spirit in which...

255
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:27,808
他说什么?
What did he say?

256
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:29,658
你只是碰运气预感到的
You had a lucky hunch.

257
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,408
谢尔顿  我刚才一直在想
Hey, sheldon, I've been thinking.

258
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:33,448
我们一直争执这个问题还不如...
Instead of arguing about this...

259
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,238
不要再跟我说话
Don't you ever speak to me again.

260
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,688
什...?
Wha...?

261
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:43,148
他...
He...

262
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:57,177
我去参加会议了
Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.

263
00:11:57,187 --> 00:11:59,667
祝你演讲我那"幸运的预感"愉快
Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch."

264
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,297
谢尔顿  我不是那个意思
Shel, I didn't mean it like that.

265
00:12:01,297 --> 00:12:02,117
那你为什么要那么说
Then why did you say it?

266
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:03,257
我不知道  我不是...
I don't know. I wasn't...

267
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:04,727
你是想取悦潘妮?
Were you trying to impress penny?

268
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:07,677
不  不  完全不是  有那么一点
No, no, not at all. a little bit.

269
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:10,317
那么做有效果吗
How'd that work out for you?

270
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:11,747
莱纳德  准备走了吗
Leonard, ready to go?

271
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:15,647
力比多(弗洛伊德理论)  1-0
libido 1.0.

272
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:18,257
好  我再问你一次
Okay, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

273
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:19,347
这个成果是咱们一起完成的
We did the work together.

274
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:20,777
就让咱们一起去做演讲
Let's present the paper together.

275
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:22,517
我也跟你说最后一遍
And I'm telling you for the last time

276
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:25,457
你这是在拉皮条  这是没有尊严的  咬我吧
It's pandering, it's undignified, and bite me.

277
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:28,717
我们走吧
Let's go.

278
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:29,977
再见  谢尔顿
Bye, sheldon.

279
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:31,617
再见  潘妮
Good-bye, penny.

280
00:12:42,217 --> 00:12:43,887
就在未来的某一天...
One of these days...

281
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,427
还不错
There you go.

282
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:50,077
你说的没错  这面果然更好看
You're right. this side does look better.

283
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:51,717
不  不  我没说"更好看"
No, no, I didn't say "better."

284
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:53,347
我只是说"褪色少一些"
I said "less stained."

285
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,877
我刚观察了下  里面大约
i just checked the house. there's probably

286
00:12:56,887 --> 00:12:58,097
有20-25个人
20-25 people in there.

287
00:12:58,097 --> 00:12:59,117
开玩笑吧?
You're kidding?

288
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:00,917
-一共就这些?  -就这些? 
Is that all? "all"?

289
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:04,317
对高能物理学领域来说  25人已称得上伍德斯托克(摇滚音乐节)了
In particle physics, 25 is woodstock.

290
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:07,547
这样啊  那不错
Oh, well, then good.

291
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,697
我没想到会有这么多人  我有点紧张
I wasn't expecting such a crowd. I'm a little nervous.

292
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:12,217
没事  讲个笑话做开场白就不紧张了
It's okay. just open with a joke. you'll be fine.

293
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:14,777
笑话  好的
Uh, joke. okay,

294
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:16,647
这个怎么样?
How about this?

295
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:19,247
有个农民
Um, okay, uh, there's this farmer,

296
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,747
他养了一些鸡
And he has these chickens,

297
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:25,217
但是它们不下蛋  所以他去找物理学家求救
But they won't lay any eggs, so he calls a physicist to help.

298
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:28,377
这个物理学家便做了些计算
The physicist then does some calculations,

299
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:31,817
然后说"我有个办法
And he says, "i have a solution,

300
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:36,587
不过只适用于真空环境下的球形鸡(加拿大科学家凯伊的方法)"
But it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum."

301
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:40,387
好笑吧?
Right?

302
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:47,477
抱歉  我...我以前听过
Oh, sorry, I just... I've heard it before.

303
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:48,517
-我们进去吧  -好的 
Let's roll. okay.

304
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,517
西服不错
Hey, nice suit.

305
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:50,647
一流的  是吧?
It's a classic, right?

306
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:54,997
我真应该把我的车开来
I really should have brought my own car.

307
00:13:56,857 --> 00:13:59,327
因此我们总结如下  数据表明
So, in conclusion, the data show

308
00:13:59,327 --> 00:14:01,477
当温度接近绝对零度时
That at temperatures approaching absolute zero,

309
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,247
转动惯量就会发生改变
The moment of inertia changes,

310
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:06,617
而固体就会变成一种超固体
And the solid becomes a supersolid which clearly appears

311
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:10,157
成为一种之前未知的物质
To be a previously unknown state of matter.

312
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:14,757
谢谢
Thank you.

313
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,757
请问有任何问题吗
Were there any questions?

314
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:22,347
有  那到底是什么玩意?
Yeah, what the hell was that?

315
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,357
还有其他问题吗
Any other questions?

316
00:14:26,357 --> 00:14:28,477
我是谢尔顿・库珀博士
Dr. sheldon cooper here.

317
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:31,427
是这篇论文的第一作者
I am the lead author of this particular paper.

318
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:34,957
谢谢
Thank you.

319
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:39,077
而你  这位先生  完全跳过了一个重要部分
And you, sir, you have completely skipped over the part

320
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,877
当时我是在公园里散步
Where I was walking through the park,

321
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,947
看见小孩们在玩旋转木马
And I saw these children on a merry-go-round,

322
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:45,447
正是这才让我想起转动惯性
Which started me thinking about the moment of inertia

323
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:46,977
当温度接近绝对零度
In gases like helium

324
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,047
在气体里  比如氦气里的表现
At temperatures approaching absolute zero.

325
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:50,717
我没有跳过  这只是个小插曲
I didn't skip it. it's just an anecdote.

326
00:14:50,727 --> 00:14:51,717
不是科学
It's not science.

327
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:52,917
原来是这样
Oh, I see.

328
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,017
那么苹果落在牛顿的头上
Was the apple falling on newton's head,

329
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:56,317
也仅仅是个小插曲?
Was that just an anecdote?

330
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:57,567
你不是艾萨克・牛顿
You are not isaac newton.

331
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:58,697
是  是  这倒是不错
No, no, that's true.

332
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:01,817
对我来说  不用那苹果我也会知道是地球引力
Gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.

333
00:15:01,827 --> 00:15:03,577
你能不能不那么自大
You could not possibly be that arrogant.

334
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:06,347
你仍旧低估了我  我的伙计
You continue to underestimate me, my good man.

335
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:08,277
听着  如果你因为我的演讲而不高兴
Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation,

336
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,377
那你应该跟我一起来讲的
Then maybe you should have given it with me.

337
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,407
就像我反复解释的  我不像你
As I've explained repeatedly, unlike you,

338
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:14,877
我不需要比我笨的人来认可我
I don't need validation from lesser minds.

339
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:16,317
没有别的意思
No offense.

340
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:17,817
那你还为什么来?
So why did you come?

341
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:19,247
因为我知道你会把它糟蹋了的
Because I knew you'd screw this up.

342
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:20,247
我才没有糟蹋
I didn't screw it up

343
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:21,187
开玩笑
Oh, please,

344
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,767
-我承认那个球形鸡的笑话...是挺好笑  -谢谢
I admit that spherical chicken joke-- that was hilarious. Thanks.

345
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:26,127
不过从那里开始就急转直下了
But it was straight downhill from there.

346
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:28,117
我受够了你这种高傲的态度
I've had enough of your condescension.

347
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:30,997
也许我没有像你一样11岁就考上大学
Maybe I didn't go to college when I was 11 like you.

348
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:34,497
也许我是24岁才拿到博士  而不像你是16岁
Maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16,

349
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:35,757
但你不是这个屋子里
But you are not the only person

350
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:38,677
唯一一个比他们都聪明的人
Who is smarter than everyone else in this room

351
00:15:38,927 --> 00:15:40,487
没别的意思
No offense.

352
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:43,547
我显然并不是这里唯一一个
And I am clearly not the only person

353
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:44,817
怀着不安全感  渴望得到
Who is tormented by insecurity

354
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:47,777
不断的肯定  并为之饱受苦恼的人
And has an ego in need of constant validation.

355
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:49,317
那你承认你是个自大狂了?
So you admit that you're an egotist?

356
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:50,847
对
Yes

357
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:52,947
我是莱纳德・霍夫斯塔德博士
My name is dr. leonard hofstadter

358
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:54,477
我从不讨我父母喜欢
And I could never please my parents,

359
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,217
所以我需要从你们这些陌生人这里
So I need to get all my self-esteem

360
00:15:56,227 --> 00:15:57,217
把自尊心都找回来
From strangers like you.

361
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:58,527
但他更差劲
But he's worse

362
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:01,277
-好的  够了  -别闹了
Okay, that is it stop it

363
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:06,577
你不可能用意念爆了我的头
You cannot blow up my head with your mind

364
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:08,677
那给你弄个动脉瘤也成
Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.

365
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:09,747
别弄了
Stop it

366
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:10,647
你打我
You hit me

367
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:11,957
你们都看到了  他打我
You saw that. he hit me.

368
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:13,297
是你想爆了我的头
You were trying to blow up my head.

369
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:14,357
所以还是起作用了
So it was working.

370
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:16,527
才不是呢  你简直是个疯子
It was not you are a nut case

371
00:16:16,537 --> 00:16:17,847
我们来看看
We'll see about that.

372
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,647
把头抬起来  坐第一排的人
Heads up, you people in the front row.

373
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:21,377
这里是辐射区
This is a splash zone.

374
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:22,177
别闹了
Stop it

375
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:23,767
停下来
Quit it

376
00:16:29,107 --> 00:16:31,477
你们搞物理的经常这样?
Is this usually how these physics things go?

377
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,807
比你想的要频繁
More often than you think.

378
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:39,427
停下  我要发功把你弄爆
Stop it nerve pinch

379
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:51,997
你可以让我搭车一起回来的
You could have offered me a ride home.

380
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:56,047
我没开车把你碾过去你已经很幸运了
You're lucky I didn't run you over.

381
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,377
我真不知道你在不开心些什么
I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about.

382
00:16:58,387 --> 00:16:59,767
你求我去  我去了
You begged me to come. I came.

383
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:02,147
结果你还是不高兴
There's just no pleasing you.

384
00:17:02,157 --> 00:17:03,377
没错  问题都在我这
You're right. I'm the problem.

385
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:04,947
我是那个需要帮助的人
I'm the one that needs help.

386
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,577
这不是很像道歉
Well, that's not much of an apology,

387
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:08,047
但我接受了
But I'll take it.

388
00:17:08,057 --> 00:17:10,127
等等
Excuse me.

389
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,987
你有没有什么想向我道歉?
Is there anything you would like to apologize for?

390
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:15,847
有
Yes.

391
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:19,287
我有想要爆了你的头  对不起
I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.

392
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:22,077
那样做没有必要
It was uncalled for.

393
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:23,217
你们不会相信的
You won't believe this.

394
00:17:23,227 --> 00:17:24,747
有人把整件事情经过用手机拍下来了
Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone

395
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:26,467
并上传到了Youtube
And put it on youtube.

396
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:28,777
什么?
What?

397
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:30,977
谁会这么缺德?
Now who would do that?

398
00:17:30,987 --> 00:17:32,957
是我
That would be me.

399
00:17:34,057 --> 00:17:35,927
快来看看  很有意思的视频
Hey, check it out. it's a featured video.

400
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:36,577
你打我
You hit me

401
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:37,677
你们都看到了  他打我
You saw that he hit me

402
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:38,697
是你想爆了我的头
You're trying to blow up my head.

403
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:39,867
所以还是起作用了
So it was working.

404
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:41,537
别弄了  你简直是个疯子
Stop it you're a nut case.

405
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:42,787
我们来看看
We'll see about that.

406
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:45,707
你们前排的人  把头抬起来  这里是辐射区
You people in the front row, heads up. this is a splash zone.

407
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:48,277
别闹了
Stop it

408
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,327
停下来  停下来
Quit it quit it

409
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:55,247
我要发功把你弄爆
Put you in a vulcan nerve pinch

410
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:59,447
你应该剪剪指甲  真疼死了
Ow, you should cut your fingernails. those hurt

411
