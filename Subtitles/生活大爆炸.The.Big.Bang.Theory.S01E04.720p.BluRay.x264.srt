1
00:00:02,806 --> 00:00:05,466
我最近又在想着时光旅行的事了
you know,I've been thinking about time travel again.

2
00:00:05,476 --> 00:00:08,286
为什么 你又撞上看不见的障碍物了?
Why,did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?

3
00:00:09,736 --> 00:00:11,846
先不说那个
Put it on the back burner.

4
00:00:12,036 --> 00:00:15,396
我想到 如果我发明了完美的时间机器
Anyway,it occurs to me if I ever did perfect a time machine,

5
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:17,616
我会回到过去把它送给自己
I would just go into the past and give it to myself,

6
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:21,276
省得要自己再去发明它一次
thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.

7
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:22,986
不错
Interesting.

8
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:25,176
是啊 这样能让我减压不少
Yeah,it really takes the pressure off.

9
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,796
听起来像是个大突破
Sounds like a breakthrough.

10
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:30,396
要我打电话给科学杂志 让他们留下头版的位置吗?
Should I call science magazine and tell them to hold the cover?

11
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:33,276
这可是时间旅行 莱纳德 过去的我已经打过了
It's time travel,leonard,I will have already done that.

12
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:36,836
那我想就等着祝贺你啦
Then I guess congratulations are in order.

13
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:40,406
不 过去的你已经祝贺过我了
No,congratulations will have been in order.

14
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:42,946
我肯定在派对上不会开心的
You know,I am not going to enjoy this party.

15
00:00:42,956 --> 00:00:45,496
我知道 我太了解你
I know,I'm familiar with you.

16
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:48,126
上次系里的派对 芬克顿教授抓着我
The last department party,professor finkleday cornered me

17
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:50,596
讨论洞穴探险 一直说了45分钟
and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.

18
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:51,886
是的 我也在场
Yes,I was there.

19
00:00:51,896 --> 00:00:53,806
你知道窑洞有什么意思吗 莱纳德?
You know what's interesting about caves,leonard?

20
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:55,506
- 什么? - 什么也没有
- What? - Nothing.

21
00:00:57,106 --> 00:00:59,776
那我们躲开他 去见到新的系主任
Well,then we'll avoid finkleday,we'll meet the new department head,

22
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:01,556
恭喜他 跟他握手 然后就走
congratulate him,shake his hand and go.

23
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:02,696
这样如何?
How's this?

24
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:04,656
"见到你很高兴 盖博豪斯博士"
"Pleased to meet you,dr.Gablehauser.

25
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,626
"您真幸运 学校雇了你做系主任"
"How fortunate for you that the university's "chosen to hire you,

26
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:10,976
"尽管您25年来都没做出什么原创研究"
despite the fact "that you've done no original research in 25 years,

27
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:13,146
"而只是出版了一系列畅销书"
"and instead have written a series of popular books "

28
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,086
"将科学的伟大概念 降格为一系列奇闻轶事"
that reduce the great concepts of science "to a series of anecdotes,

29
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:17,616
"每则故事都简单到 
"each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration

30
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:21,266
能在一次肠部运动的时间内看完" (就是厕所读物)
of an average bowel movement.

31
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:23,956
Mahalo (夏威夷语的谢谢)
Mahalo.

32
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:29,296
"Mahalo"是不错的修饰
"Mahalo's" a nice touch.

33
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:32,336
你知道夏威夷语里只有8个辅音吗?
You know there only eight consonants in the hawaiian language?

34
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:34,636
很好 你就这么做开场白吧
Interesting. You should lead with that.

35
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:38,746
瞧瞧这自助餐
Oh,god,look at this buffet.

36
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:41,416
我爱美国
I love america.

37
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:43,076
印度没自助餐吗?
You don't have buffets in india?

38
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:45,456
当然有 可那些都是印度菜
Of course,but it's all indian food.

39
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:49,146
在孟买你可能连救命的面包圈都找不到
You can't find a bagel in mumbai to save your life.

40
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:51,066
给我涂点
Shmear me.

41
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,776
真是有趣
Well,here's an interesting turn of events.

42
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:56,436
怎么了?
What?

43
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:59,156
霍华德带了女伴?
Howard brought a date?

44
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,866
最有可能性的解释是
A more plausible explanation is

45
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:04,106
他在机器人方面的研究 取得了重大进展
that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.

46
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:07,896
怎样 科学怪人们?
Hey,what up,science bitches?

47
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:12,226
这位是我特别的女性朋友桑茉
May I introduce my special lady friend summer?

48
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:14,016
霍华德 我说了碰我要加钱的
Howard,I told you touching's extra.

49
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:16,146
好 抱歉
Right. Sorry.

50
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:19,386
我们的新老板来了 礼貌点
Here comes our new boss. Be polite.

51
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:20,766
大家好
Hi,fellas.

52
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:22,806
- 我是艾瑞克・盖博豪斯 - 我是霍华德・沃罗威茨
- Eric gablehauser. - Howard wolowitz.

53
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:26,046
霍华德 见到你很高兴 你是?
Howard,nice to meet you. And you are?

54
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:29,886
一个真真正正的科学家
An actual real scientist.

55
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:33,876
这个开场白怎样?
How was that?

56
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:37,496
我不敢相信他开除我了
I can't believe he fired me.

57
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,336
你说他是被捧出来的高中理科老师
Well,you did call him a glorified high school science teacher

58
00:02:40,346 --> 00:02:44,716
还说他上一次成功的试验 是点燃了自己的屁
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.

59
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,766
但我之前说了"恕我直言"
In my defense,I prefaced that by saying,"with all due respect."

60
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:12,098
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第04集
The.Luminous.Fish.Effect

61
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:18,348
早
Morning.

62
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:19,868
早
Morning.

63
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:22,008
今天早餐 你做鸡蛋吃?
You're making eggs for breakfast?

64
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:24,698
这不是早餐 这是试验
This isn't breakfast,it's an experiment.

65
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,908
但看起来很像早餐
'Cause it looks a lot like breakfast.

66
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:32,688
我终于有时间验证我的理论 从蛋白质中分离水分子
I finally have time to test my hypothesis about the separation of the water molecules

67
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:36,658
以及它对口感的影响
from the egg proteins and its impact vis-a-vis taste.

68
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:39,908
听起来真开胃
Sounds yummy.

69
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:42,358
我很期待你配上熏肉后的成果 
I look forward to your work with bacon.

70
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:44,298
我也是
As do I.

71
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:47,888
我相信只要你跟盖博豪斯道歉 
You know,I'm sure if you just apologize to gablehauser,

72
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:49,608
他会让你回去工作的
he would give you your job back.

73
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:51,198
我不想回去工作
I don't want my job back.

74
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:55,188
过去三年半时间我都在瞪着 写满方程式的板子上
I've spent the past three and a half years staring at grease boards full of equations.

75
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:57,758
在那之前我花了四年时间写论文
Before that,I spent four years working on my thesis.

76
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:01,878
在那之前 我在上大学 而在大学之前 我在上5年级
Before that,I was in college,and before that,I was in the fifth grade.

77
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:06,748
这是我十几年来第一次休息 我要好好享受
This is my first d oayff in decades and I'm going to savor it.

78
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:08,748
好吧
Okay.

79
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:10,828
那你回去弄你的鸡蛋吧
I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.

80
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:14,478
不只是我的鸡蛋 弄的是全人类的蛋
Not just fixing my eggs,I'm fixing everyone's eggs.

81
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:17,048
我们都感激你
And we all thank you.

82
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:50,568
要用新鲜鸡蛋
use new eggs.

83
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,228
嗨 我正要去超市
hi. Hey,I'm running out to the market.

84
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:56,648
你们要带什么吗?
Do you guys need anything?

85
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:59,188
这就是那些不熟悉数学规律的人
Oh,well,this would be one of those circumstances that

86
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,968
会称之为巧合的事件之一了
people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.

87
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:03,998
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

88
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:04,978
我要蛋
I need eggs.

89
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:06,448
4打就够了
Four dozen should suffice.

90
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,208
4打?
Four dozen?

91
00:05:07,218 --> 00:05:09,538
对 棕蛋 白蛋
Yes,and evenly distributed amongst brown,white,

92
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:12,828
走地鸡蛋 大鸡蛋 加大鸡蛋 跟特大鸡蛋各要8个
free-range,large,extra large and jumbo.

93
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:14,208
好 再说一次
Okay,one more time.

94
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:16,538
算了 你肯定搞不对
Never mind. You won't get it right.

95
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:18,698
我最好跟你一起去
I'd better come with you.

96
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:21,128
好呀
Oh,yay.

97
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:27,108
你今天怎么没去上班?
How come you didn't go into work today?

98
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:31,988
我在休假 因为我不愿向平庸之流屈服
I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.

99
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,108
你给开除了?
So you got canned,huh?

100
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:37,618
理论上说物理学家不会给开除...
Theoretical physicists do not get canned...

101
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,498
但你说对了
but yeah.

102
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,488
可能这样最好
Well,maybe it's all for the best.

103
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:45,098
我相信一扇门关上了  总会有另外一扇门打开的
You know,I always say when one door closes,another one opens.

104
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:46,938
不 不是的
No,it doesn'T.

105
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:49,968
除非两扇门用继电器连接 
Not unless the two doors are connected by relays

106
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:51,708
而且还装有传感器
or there are motion sensors involved.

107
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,308
不 我是说...
No,no,I meant...

108
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,498
或者一扇门关上时产生的空气 
or if the first door closing creates a change of air pressure

109
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:56,688
压力作用于第二扇门引致...
that acts upon the second door.

110
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:59,298
算了
Never mind.

111
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:01,268
慢点
Slow down.

112
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,208
慢点! 拜托慢点!
Slow down. Please,slow down!

113
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:04,168
没事啦!
We're fine!

114
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:06,818
你跟车都不保持足够的距离
You're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.

115
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:07,798
我有啊!
Oh,sure,I am.

116
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:09,638
不 我给你算算
No,no,let me do the math for you.

117
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:12,138
就算这车重4000磅
This car weighs,let's say 4,000 pounds.

118
00:06:12,148 --> 00:06:14,538
我140磅 你120磅
Now add 140 for me,120 for you...

119
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,468
- 120? - 不好意思
- 120? - Oh,I'm sorry.

120
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:17,658
冒犯你了吗?
Did I insult you?

121
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,718
你的体重跟自我价值有关系?
Is your body mass somehow tied into your self-worth?

122
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,998
当然
Well,yeah.

123
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,258
有趣
Interesting.

124
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:27,808
那么我们就算总重4400磅吧
Anyway,that gives us a total weight of,let's say 4,400 pounds.

125
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:29,998
算4390磅
Let's say 4,390.

126
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:31,478
好
Fine.

127
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:35,438
目前时速是 老天啊 51英里/时
We're traveling forward at-- good lord-- 51 miles an hour.

128
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:38,788
假设你的刹车是新的 卡钳也是校准的
Now let's assume that your brakes are new and the calipers are aligned.

129
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,528
当我们踩下刹车时
Still,by the time we come to a stop,

130
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:43,118
我们就会和前面的别克汽车撞在一起
we'll be occupying the same space as that buick in front of us,

131
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:47,058
因此我们会在短时间内 给压成稀泥 死得很惨...
an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death,mutilation...

132
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:50,348
哇 看 他们在铺新的迷你高尔夫场地
oh,look,they built a new putt-putt course.

133
00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:54,968
真不错
This is great.

134
00:06:54,978 --> 00:06:56,118
看看我
Look at me.

135
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:59,488
我生活在普通人的平凡世界中 
I'm in the real world of ordinary people

136
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:02,128
过着他们无趣平常的一天
just living their ordinary,colorless workaday lives.

137
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:03,708
谢谢
Thank you.

138
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:05,658
不 谢谢你
No,thank you.

139
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:08,278
还有谢谢你 普通人
And thank you,ordinary person.

140
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:12,378
你想知道关于番茄的趣闻吗?
Hey,you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes?

141
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:13,758
不 不是很想
Uh,no,no,not really.

142
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:16,838
你不是要买鸡蛋的吗?
Listen,didn't you say you needed some eggs?

143
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:20,218
对 但任何对细菌繁殖学稍有了解的人
Yes,but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth

144
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:23,618
都会在出去结账时 才买冰柜里的食物
knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.

145
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:27,128
那好 那你现在就该准备出去了
Oh,okay,well,then maybe you should start heading on out then.

146
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:29,638
不 这样很好玩啊
No,this is fun.

147
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:32,238
关于番茄的事 我觉得你肯定会喜欢的
Oh,the thing about tomatoes-- and I think you'll really enjoy this--

148
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:36,138
它们给摆在蔬菜栏里 但事实上却是一种水果
is they're shelved with the vegetables,but they're technically a fruit.

149
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:37,688
- 真有意思 - 是吧?
- Oh,interesting. - Isn't it?

150
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:40,528
不 我指的是你觉得有趣的事情很有趣
No,I mean what you find enjoyable.

151
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,218
天啊
Oh,boy.

152
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:49,318
又怎么了?
What now?

153
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:51,758
服用维生素剂虽然有一定好处
Well,there's some value to taking a multivitamin,

154
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:54,188
但人体能吸收的量是有限的
but the human body can only absorb so much.

155
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:58,228
你买这么多 就是买的一堆昂贵的尿液原料
What you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.

156
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,058
也许那就是我的目的呢
Well,maybe that's what I was going for.

157
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:06,178
那你可以买锰
Well,then you'll want some manganese.

158
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:13,178
刚刚很好玩呀
Well,that was fun.

159
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:15,908
也许明天我们能 一起去那种仓储式商店
Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.

160
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:17,068
我不知道哦 谢尔顿
Oh,I don't know,sheldon.

161
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:20,898
我要花一段时间才能 从今天度过的乐趣中恢复过来
It's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.

162
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:22,818
你确定?
Are you sure?

163
00:08:22,828 --> 00:08:25,308
大宗采购有很多优势呀
There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk.

164
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:30,438
比如说 我发现你的卫生巾一次是购买一个月的量
For example,I noticed that you purchase your tampons one-month supply at a time.

165
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:33,548
什么?
What?

166
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:34,208
想想啊
Think about it.

167
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:35,968
这种东西放着也不会变坏 
It's a product that doesn't spoil

168
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:38,898
而且你接下来至少30年都要用它
and you're going to be needing them for at least the next 30 years.

169
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:43,268
你要我一次性买30年份的?
You want me to buy 30 years worth of tampons?

170
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,348
30或35年 你母亲什么时候绝经的? 
Well,30,35. When did your mother go into menopause?

171
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:47,168
好了
Okay.

172
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:49,938
我才不跟你说这个
I'm not talking about this with you.

173
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:52,608
这是很自然的人类进程 
Oh,penny,this is a natural human process

174
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:55,028
而且我们讨论怎么省钱的问题
and we're talking about statistically significant savings.

175
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:59,078
现在假设你每次用15条 28天一周期...
Now,if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28-day cycle...

176
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,658
你经期正常吗?
are you fairly regular?

177
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:09,728
好吧 不去仓储式商店 但我们还是一起去高尔夫 对吧
Okay,no warehouse store,but we're still on for putt-putt golf,right?

178
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:16,558
我刚碰到佩里
Hey,I just ran into penny.

179
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:18,628
她好像有点心烦
She seemed upset about something.

180
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:21,058
可能她大姨妈来了吧
I think it's her time of the month.

181
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:26,108
我在日历上做记录 以备参考
I marked the calendar for future reference.

182
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:31,218
鱼是怎么回事?
What's with the fish?

183
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:33,228
是实验呀
It's an experiment.

184
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:36,318
你的炒蛋研究呢?
What happened to your scrambled egg research?

185
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:37,668
那是死路一条
Oh,that was a dead end.

186
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,818
炒蛋怎么弄也就这样啦
Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.

187
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:43,988
那...现在研究鱼?
So... fish?

188
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:47,038
我看到一篇文章 说日本科学家 
I read an article about japanese scientists

189
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:49,778
将发光水母的DNA注入到其他动物体内
who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals

190
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:54,218
我就想 "哦 夜光鱼"
and I thought,"hey,fish nightlights.

191
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,308
夜光鱼?
Fish nightlights?

192
00:09:58,318 --> 00:09:59,928
这是个能发大财的主意
It's a billion-dollar idea.

193
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,208
我不会出去
Mum's the word.

194
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:06,988
谢尔顿 你确定不要跟 
Sheldon,are you sure you don't want to

195
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:09,358
系主任道歉 然后回去上班啊?
just apologize to gablehauser and get your job back?

196
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:12,498
不不不 我有太多事情要做
Oh,no,no,no,I have too much to do.

197
00:10:13,118 --> 00:10:14,508
比如说发光鱼
Like luminous fish.

198
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:16,868
对不起 我不知道
I'm sorry. I didn'T...

199
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:20,228
这只是个开头
that's just the beginning.

200
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:24,518
我还有个大宗女性护理用品 邮购公司的设想
I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company.

201
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:27,018
夜光卫生棉条!
Oh,glow-in-the-dark tampons!

202
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:32,678
莱纳德 我们会暴富
Leonard,we're gonna be rich.

203
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,998
谢谢你这么快赶过来
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

204
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:39,308
你给我打电话是对的
Well,you did the right thing calling.

205
00:10:39,318 --> 00:10:40,448
我不知道还能怎么办
I didn't know what else to do.

206
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,758
他失去生活的重心了
He's lost all focus.

207
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,208
每天他都沉迷于一个新想法
Every day he's got a new obsession.

208
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:53,998
这一个让我特别困扰
This is a particularly disturbing one.

209
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:57,978
妈妈?
Mommy?

210
00:10:58,198 --> 00:11:00,848
宝贝!
Hi,baby!

211
00:11:01,498 --> 00:11:04,348
</i>你给我妈打电话了?!<i>

212
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:14,515
你给自己弄了个纺织机? 真棒!
Oh,you got yourself a loom? How nice!

213
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:15,655
谢谢
Thank you.

214
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:18,075
亲爱的 为什么要弄台纺织机?
Honey,why'd you get a loom?

215
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:23,055
我在研究发光鱼 所以我想到...
I was working with luminous fish,and I thought,hey...

216
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:26,285
"纺织机" (英语中"纺织机"与"发光"发音部分相同)
"loom."

217
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:30,085
你来这干嘛 妈妈?
Mom,what are you doing here?

218
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:31,755
莱纳德给我打电话了
Leonard called me.

219
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:33,635
我知道 为什么?
I know,but why?

220
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:36,895
因为21世纪最聪明的脑袋 
Because one of the great minds of the 21st century

221
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:40,395
用在了养夜光鱼 和编织毛毯上
is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving serapes.

222
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:43,045
这不是披肩 这是披风
This is not a serape,this is a poncho.

223
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:45,255
披肩两边不收边 披风是一体的
A serape is open at the sides; a poncho is closed.

224
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:46,185
所以这是披风
This is a poncho.

225
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:50,065
不管是什么 都不能成为 你打电话给别人母亲的理由
And neither is a reason to call someone's mother.

226
00:11:50,915 --> 00:11:53,995
是吗? 你上一次出门是什么时候?
Really? When was the last time you left the house?

227
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,695
跟佩里去超市
I went to the market with penny.

228
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:57,575
对 那是三周以前的事了
Yeah,that was three weeks ago.

229
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:02,115
那么小心啦 接下来的4到8天她会变得很暴躁
Well,then buckle up-- in the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby.

230
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:07,425
亲爱的 你的朋友很担心你
Sweetheart,your little friend is concerned about you.

231
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:12,135
但我是成年人了 我能过自己想要的生活
Yes,well,I'm not a child-- I'm a grown man,capable of living my life as I see fit.

232
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:16,065
我也绝不需要 有打小报告人给我的妈妈!
And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother!

233
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,025
等等 你去哪?
Wait,where are you going?

234
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:20,915
我房间! 所有人都不许进来!
To my room-- and no one's allowed in!

235
00:12:22,955 --> 00:12:25,545
他的脾气像他爸爸
oh,he gets his temper from his daddy.

236
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:28,265
- 眼睛像我 - 原来如此
- He's got my eyes. - I see.

237
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:31,775
他的科学头脑是上帝赐予的
All that science stuff,that comes from jesus.

238
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:36,625
谢尔顿 你妈妈做了晚饭
Sheldon,your mom made dinner.

239
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:38,395
我不饿!
I'm not hungry!

240
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,735
莱纳德 你别管了 他很固执的
Oh,leonard,don't trouble yourself. He's stubborn.

241
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:43,185
他会一直待到他满意为止
He may stay in there till the rapture.

242
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:46,925
确定那是件坏事?
We so sure that's a bad thing?

243
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:49,775
跟你说 我很爱那孩子 但他很难相处
I tell you,I love the boy to death,but he has been difficult

244
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:52,345
自从他在Kmart超市 从我身体里滑出来后
since he fell out of me at the k-mart.

245
00:12:54,675 --> 00:13:00,315
原谅我的无礼 但我终于知道谢尔顿 英俊的外表是从哪继承的了
Excuse me for being so bold,but I now see where sheldon gets his smoldering good looks.

246
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:04,855
亲爱的 这不会起作用的 但你可以继续尝试
Honey,that ain't gonna work,but you keep tryin'.

247
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:07,255
我做了鸡肉
I made chicken.

248
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:12,365
我希望你们那里 不会把他当做神圣的动物
I hope that isn't one of the animals that you people think is magic.

249
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:20,105
我们教堂里有一个印度人
You know,we have an indian gentleman at our church,

250
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:22,655
派特医生 这是个感人的故事
a dr.Patel-- it's a beautiful story.

251
00:13:22,665 --> 00:13:27,245
上帝给与他启示 把他带来我们身边 让我们享受8折手术
The lord spoke to him and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasik--

252
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:29,695
你知道 给那些需要做这手术的人
you know,those that needed it.

253
00:13:29,705 --> 00:13:31,195
真是个感人的故事
That is a lovely story.

254
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:33,505
谢尔顿的事 我们不用做什么吗?
Um,are we gonna do anything about sheldon?

255
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:34,365
当然要
Oh,we will.

256
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,465
对付谢尔顿要慢慢来
You have to take your time with sheldon.

257
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:38,605
他死去的爸爸过去总跟我说
His father,god rest his soul,used to always say to me,

258
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:41,835
"玛丽 对谢尔顿要耐心"
"mary,you have to take your time with sheldon."

259
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:44,155
听起来是个睿智的人啊
Sounds like a wise man.

260
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:45,725
没那么睿智
Oh,not so wise.

261
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:49,035
他有一次为了甘草跟山猫打了一架
He once tried to fight a bobcat for some licorice.

262
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:55,005
大家拿盘子 还有谢尔顿织的餐垫
So,everybody grab a plate and a pretty place mat that shelly wove.

263
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:57,555
他以前也这么发作过吗?
Has shelly ever freaked out like this before?

264
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:59,145
总是这样
Oh,all the time.

265
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:01,505
我记得他13岁时的夏天
I remember one summer when he was 13,

266
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:04,845
他在小屋里做了一个小型原子反应堆
he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed

267
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:08,065
然后跟大家说 他会为全镇人提供免费电力
and told everybody he was gonna provide free electricity for the whole town.

268
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:13,005
问题是 他没有你们所说的"可裂变物质"
Well,the only problem was,he had no what you call "fissionable" materials.

269
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:16,425
当他试图上网采购时
Anyway,when he went on the internets to get some,

270
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:21,095
一个政府官员来访 很温柔地让他坐下
a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle,

271
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:25,595
告诉他 私人持有铀精矿是违法的
and told him it's against the law to have yellow-cake uranium in a shed.

272
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:26,975
然后呢?
Well,what happened?

273
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:28,515
发作了呀
Well,poor boy had a fit.

274
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:32,705
把自己锁在屋里 做了个音速死亡放射线仪
Locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.

275
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:33,675
死亡放射线?
A death ray?

276
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,155
他是这么叫的
Well,that's what he called it.

277
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,645
那玩意都阻止不了隔壁的小孩
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.

278
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:41,025
倒是让家里的狗折腾个没完
It pissed our dog off to no end.

279
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:45,765
知道吗 你俩真是可爱的一对
You know,you two make a cute couple.

280
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:47,865
不 我们不是...
uh,no. We're not...

281
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,355
不是一对 我们都是单身
we're not-not a couple. We're singles.

282
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:50,175
- 两个单身 - 对
- Two singles. - Yeah.

283
00:14:50,185 --> 00:14:54,245
像是那种...独立包装的芝士片
Like those... individually wrapped slices of cheese that...

284
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:57,515
我们是朋友
we're friends.

285
00:14:58,705 --> 00:14:59,825
我是不是踩到地雷了?
Did I pluck a nerve there?

286
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:01,365
- 对 - 好吧
- Oh,yeah. - Okay.

287
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,755
好吧 大家 该吃饭了
All right,everybody,it's time to eat.

288
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:09,525
主啊 感谢您赐予我们晚餐 及您所有的恩赐
Oh,lord,we thank you for this meal and all of your bounty.

289
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:13,295
我们祈求您帮助谢尔顿重新振作
And we pray that you help sheldon get back on his rocker.

290
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:18,735
沉思一阵之后 我会以"以主之名"结束
Now,after a moment of silent meditation,I'm gonna end with "in jesus' name,"

291
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:22,025
但你们俩不一定要跟着一起说
but you two don't feel any obligation to join in.

292
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:25,935
当然 除非你被圣灵感动
Unless,of course,the holy spirit moves you.

293
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,995
哇 这是我吃过最好吃的厚皮馅饼
Oh,my god,this is the best cobbler I've ever had.

294
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,745
谢尔顿最喜欢吃这个
It was always sheldon's favorite.

295
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:42,125
你知道秘方是什么吗?
You know w thathe secret ingredient is?

296
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:44,355
- 爱? - 猪油
- Love? - Lard.

297
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:49,985
看看谁来了...
Hey,look who's come...

298
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:52,365
嘘 你会吓到他的
You'll spook him.

299
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:57,105
他就跟小鹿似的 你得让他过来亲近你
He's like a baby deer-- you got to let him come to you.

300
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:06,725
太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

301
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:08,915
够了! 谢尔顿 振作起来!
Damn it,sheldon,snap out of it!

302
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,385
你是物理学家 
You're a physicist--

303
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:13,535
该在学校做实验 而不是躲房间里
you belong at the university doing research,not hiding in your room!

304
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:22,665
你不打猎的 是不是?
you don't hunt,do you?

305
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,555
早上好 小饼干
good morning,snickerdoodle.

306
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:32,565
早
Morning.

307
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,885
那看起来好奇特啊 是什么呢?
Oh,well,that looks awful fancy. What is that?

308
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:41,575
我设想的硅系生物DNA模型
It's my idea of what dna would look like in a silicon-based life-form.

309
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:46,745
但是由造物主巧妙地设计?
But intelligently designed by a creator,right?

310
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,675
你想干什么呀 妈妈?
What do you want,mom?

311
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:53,005
你知道你爸爸经常说
You know how your daddy used to say that

312
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:56,095
你只能在把炸药扔进鱼塘之前 
you can only fish for so long

313
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:57,635
钓那么一会儿鱼
before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?

314
00:16:58,025 --> 00:16:58,735
记得
Yeah.

315
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:01,175
我钓够鱼了
Well,I'm done fishing.

316
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:03,985
你穿上衣服
You put those on.

317
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:04,775
为什么?
What for?

318
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:06,865
因为你要回到办公室
Because you're gonna go down to your office,

319
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,715
跟你的老板道歉 回去上班
you're gonna apologize to your boss and get your job back.

320
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:10,575
不要
No.

321
00:17:10,585 --> 00:17:15,115
不好意思 我刚刚是以 "若尊贵的陛下愿意"开始的吗?
I'm sorry,did I start that sentence with the words,"if it please your highness"?

322
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:19,875
我不要道歉 我说的都是实话
I'm not going to apologize-- I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

323
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:21,375
你听好
Now,you listen here.

324
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:24,125
我从你4岁开始就跟你说
I have been telling you since you were four years old,

325
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:28,115
比大家都聪明不是问题 但你不能到处显摆
it's okay to be smarter than everybody,but you can't go around pointing it out.

326
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:28,865
为什么?
Why not?

327
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,405
因为别人不喜欢!
Because people don't like it!

328
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:36,045
记得邻居的孩子欺负你的事吗?
Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbor kids?

329
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:39,955
动作快点
now,let's get crackin'.

330
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:43,205
沐浴更衣 然后我们就出发
Shower,shirt,shoes,and let's shove off.

331
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:49,395
如果那该死的死亡放射线能用 我就不会挨打了
There wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.

332
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:56,005
问题解决了
Problem solved.

333
00:17:56,315 --> 00:17:57,405
真的?
Really?

334
00:17:57,415 --> 00:17:58,725
真厉害
That's impressive.

335
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:02,155
莱纳德 主自有分寸
Leonard,the lord never gives us more than we can handle.

336
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:06,085
幸亏我另外两个孩子傻得像头驴
Thankfully,he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup.

337
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:13,975
抱歉 盖博豪斯博士 您在忙吗?
Excuse me,dr.Gablehauser,are you busy?

338
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:14,595
实际上...
Well,actually...

339
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:16,025
谢尔顿 他只是在乱画而已
sheldon,he's just doodlin'.

340
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:17,495
进来
Get in here.

341
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:21,855

343
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:27,115
说吧宝贝 天要黑了
Let's go,baby-- we're losing daylight.

344
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:35,655
你知道 几周前我们第一次见面时
as you know,several weeks ago in our first encounter,

345
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:40,115
我们可能没给彼此留下好印象 我称你为白痴
we may have gotten off on the wrong foot when I called you an idiot.

346
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:43,465
我只想跟你道歉...
And I just wanted to say that I was wrong...

347
00:18:43,475 --> 00:18:46,015
指出这一点是我不对
to point it out.

348
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:50,525
抱歉 我们还不认识
I'm sorry,we haven't been introduced.

349
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:51,725
艾瑞克・盖博豪斯博士
Dr.Eric gablehauser.

350
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:53,705
我叫玛丽・库珀 是谢尔顿的妈妈
Mary cooper,sheldon's mom.

351
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,195
不可能吧
Now,that's impossible--

352
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:57,225
你怀他的时候还是个少女吧
you must have had him when you were a teenager.

353
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:58,475
你嘴真甜
Oh,aren't you sweet.

354
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:00,735
他父亲过世了
His father's dead.

355
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:04,525
- 最近? - 够久的了
- Recently? - Long enough.

356
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:06,565
请坐
Please.

357
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:09,985
谢尔顿 你不该去上班啊?
sheldon,shouldn't you be working?

358
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:15,945
好的
Okay.

359
00:19:20,395 --> 00:19:22,135
怎么样?
Hey,how did it go?

360
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:23,675
我可以回来上班了
I got my job back.

361
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:25,755
真的? 怎么回事?
Really? What happened?

362
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:28,045
我不太清楚
I'm not quite sure.

363
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:32,705
其中包含的人类经验我从未经历过
It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.

364
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:35,935
那还真是缩小范围了
Well,that narrows it down.

365
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:41,923
我为你骄傲 宝贝
I'm very proud of you,honey.

366

你今天表现出了极大的勇气

谢谢你 妈妈
Thanks,mom.

368
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:51,133
妈?
Mom?

369
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:55,743
盖博豪斯博士会是我的新爸爸吗?
Is dr.Gablehauser going to be my new daddy?

370
00:19:58,383 --> 00:20:00,083
看看再说吧
We'll see.

371
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:01,183
好梦
Sleep tight.
