1
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:11,905
<i>魔兽中...</i>

2
00:00:11,915 --> 00:00:15,705
非常好 再前进几步...
all right,just a few more feet. And...

3
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:19,385
准备好 先生们 Elzebob大门到了
here we are,gentlemen,the gates of elzebob.

4
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:20,925
上帝啊
Good lord.

5
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:24,315
别慌 坚持97小时的战斗就为了这一刻
Don't panic. This is what the last 97 hours have been about.

6
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:26,665
待着别动 一群装备武器的地精
Stay frosty. There's a horde of armed goblins

7
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:29,975
正在门的另一边 守卫着艾辛诺斯之刃
on the other side of that gate guarding the sword of asaroth.

8
00:00:29,985 --> 00:00:33,385
战士们 拔出你们的武器 法师们 举起你们的魔杖
Warriors,unsheathe your weapons. Magic wielders,raise your wands.

9
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:34,535

Lock and load.

10
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:36,455
拉杰 推开大门

11
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:38,455
推开大门
Blowing the gates.

00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,475
别傻站在那里 向前开路! 向前开路!
Don't just stand there,slash and move,slash and move!

16
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:51,625
保持阵形!
Stay in formation!

17
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,035
谢尔顿 有个敌人在你背后
Leonard,you got one on your tail.

18
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:55,425
没事 我脑后长眼着呢 我会干掉他的
That's all right,my tail's prehensile- - I'll swat him off.

19
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:56,775
我打中他了 谢尔顿
I got him,leonard.

20
00:00:56,785 --> 00:01:00,545
今晚我要用那地精的血来祭酒
Tonight I spice my mead with goblin blood.

21
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:02,565
拉杰 不要 这是个陷阱! 他们在夹击我们!
Raj,no,it's a trap! They're flanking us!

22
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:04,495
我被打中了!
He's got me!

23
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:07,105
谢尔顿 他打中拉杰了 快用你的催眠咒!
Sheldon,he's got raj. Use your sleep spell!

24
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:09,075
Sheldon Sheldon?
Sheldon... sheldon?

25
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:12,545
我拿到了艾辛诺斯之刃!
I've got the sword of asaroth!

26
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:14,815
别管剑了 谢尔顿 快救拉杰!
Forget the sword,sheldon,help raj!

27
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,445
我不再是谢尔顿了
There is no more sheldon.

28
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:18,665
我是剑圣!
I am the sword master!

29
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:19,875
谢尔顿 当心!
Leonard,look out!

30
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:21,285
该死 我们快不行了!
Damn it,man,we're dying here!

31
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:22,925
再见了 土人们!
Good - bye,peasants!

32
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:25,575
那混蛋走了!
the bastard teleported!

33
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:29,845
他在Ebay上出售那把艾辛诺斯之刃
He's selling the sword of asaroth on ebay.

34
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,605
你为了钱背叛我们? 你怎么这样?
You betrayed us for money? Who are you?

35
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:37,325
我是暗夜精灵盗贼 你们没有读过角色介绍吗?
I'm a rogue night elf. Don't you people read character descriptions?

36
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:40,285

Wait,wait,wait! Somebody just clicked "buy it now.

37
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:44,005
我是剑圣!
" I am the sword master!

38
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:48,305
宇宙是个大火炉 *
Our whole universe was in a hot,dense state

39
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:51,955
140亿年前大爆炸 哦稍等 *
then nearly 14 billion years go expansion started... wait!

40
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:54,885
地球开始冷却 生物开始繁衍 *
The earth began to cool the autotrophs began to drool,

41
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:56,315
尼安得特尔人发明工具*
neanderthals developed tools

42
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,255
我们建造墙瓦 *

00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:58,245
我们创造金字塔 数学 科学 历史 *

44
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:00,975
揭露奥秘 *
math, science,history, unraveling the mystery

45
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:03,105
就从宇宙大爆炸开始! *

46
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:06,395
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第03集
The.Fuzzy.Boots.Corollary

47
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:12,275
哦 我身上都是汗  谁想再进入<第二人生>游个泳?
Ooh,I'm all sweaty. Anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming?

48
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:14,015
我刚建了个虚拟游泳池
I just built a virtual pool.

49
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:18,105
不 我现在不想看见你或是你的兽身
No. I can't look at you or your avatar right now.

50
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:23,815
好像是隔壁的声音
sounds like your neighbor's home.

51
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:27,335
失陪
Excuse me.

52
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:29,395
别忘了带上你"无意"拿到的信件
Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose

53
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:30,835
这样你就有借口跟她说话了
so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.

54
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:32,855
噢 对 对
Oh,right,right,right,right.

55
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:36,635
偷窃信箱邮件 很老套的方法 我喜欢
Stealing snail mail, very old school. I like it.

56
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:41,585
佩妮 邮差又...  哦 抱歉
Penny,the mailman,did it again... he... oh,sorry.

57
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,985
嗨 谢尔顿 这是道格
Um,oh,hi,leonard. This is doug.

58
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:45,415
道格 这是我邻居谢尔顿
Doug,this is my neighbor leonard.

59
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:47,005
有事吗 老兄?
What's up,bro?

60
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:50,895
没什么...
Not much...

61
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:53,865
老兄
bro.

62
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:55,685
一切还好吧?
Is everything okay?

63
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:58,105
是啊 我只是...  我又错拿了你的信 给你
Yeah,no,I just... I got your mail again. Here.

64
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:00,755
谢谢 我得和邮差说说了
Thank you. I've got to talk to that mailman.

65
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:03,335
不 这主意不怎么好
Oh,no,that's probably not such a good idea.

66
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:08,775
人民公仆总是非常容易...动粗
You know,civil servants have a documented propensity to,you know,snap,so...

67
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:11,915
好吧 还是谢谢你
okay. Well,thank you again.

68
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,675
没问题 再见
No problem. Bye.

69
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:17,075
哦 再见...老兄
Oh,and bye... bro.

70
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:27,175
呆呆地在想什么呢? (此谚语中正好有佩妮一词)
Penny for your thoughts.

71
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:29,495
怎么回事?
What's the matter?

72
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:32,115
我很好 佩妮也很好
I'm fine. Penny's fine.

73
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,775
和她接吻的家伙也很好
The guy she's kissing is really fine.

74
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:38,345
接吻 哪一种? 脸颊? 嘴唇? 情人? 朋友?
Kissing? What kind of kissing? Cheeks, lips, chase, French?

75
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:42,465
你什么毛病啊?
What is wrong with you?

76
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:45,655
我是个浪漫主义者
I'm a romantic.

77
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:49,195
别告诉我你不可救药的迷恋 
Please don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation

78
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,015
发展成了无意义的嫉妒
is devolving into pointless jealousy.

79
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:54,135
我不是嫉妒 只是有点担心她
I'm not jealous. I'm just a little concerned for her.

80
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:56,175
我不怎么喜欢那家伙的长相
I didn't like the look of the guy that she was with.

81
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,085
因为他长得比你帅气?
Because he looks better than you?

82
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:01,065
是啊
Yeah.

83
00:04:01,635 --> 00:04:03,565
可以说是梦幻般的外形
He was kind of dreamy.

84
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:07,025
只是你现在还能从燃烧的废墟里
Well,at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted,

85
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:09,655
找回装满对她美妙幻想的黑匣子
olsmdering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her

86
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:13,745
好好分析下数据 你就不会再坠入"呆子谷"
and analyze the data so that you don't crash into geek mountain again.

87
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:19,345
我反对 爱情不是短跑 而是马拉松
I disagree. Love is not a sprint. It's a marathon.

88
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:24,355
永不放弃地追逐 直到她最终投入你的怀抱
a relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms...

89
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,915
或是用防狼喷雾剂喷你
or hits you with the pepper spray.

90
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,795
不 我和佩妮结束了
No,I'm done with penny.

91
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:32,855
我要更现实些 去追求合我拍的人
I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.

92
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:34,055
比如谁?
Like who?

93
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,405
不知道... 奥利维亚・盖格
I don't know... olivia geiger.

94
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:39,635
自助餐厅里那个有点跛 还有弱视的营养学家?
The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?

95
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:42,775
是的
Yeah.

96
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:44,735
哦 我看你没戏
Oh,I don't think you have a shot there.

97
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,195
我注意到莱斯利・温克 最近在刮她的腿毛
I have noticed that leslie winkle recently started shaving her legs.

98
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,875
既然冬天都已经到了
Now given that winter is coming,

99
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:54,025
只能说明她是在暗示 她可以作为做爱对象
one can only assume she's signaling sexual availability.

100
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,685
我不清楚 你们在同一个实验室
I don't know. You guys work in the same lab.

101
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:57,645
所以呢?
So?

102
00:04:57,655 --> 00:05:00,765
这有隐患 相信我 我清楚
There are pitfalls. Trust me,I know.

103
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:06,255
说到性骚扰的相关法律 我可是自学而成的专家
When it comes to sexual harassment law,I'm a bit of a self taught expert.

104
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,965
霍华德 如果我要约莱斯利・温克出去 也只是吃顿饭
Look,howard,if I were to ask leslie winkle out,it would just be for dinner.

105
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:16,135
我不会去实验室  要她为我跳脱衣舞
I'm not going to walk into the lab,ask her to strip naked and dance for me.

106
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:18,225
哦 那你就没事了
Oh,then you're probably okay.

107
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:23,205
嗨 莱斯利
Hello,leslie.

108
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:24,345
嗨 谢尔顿
Hi,leonard.

109
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:25,765
莱斯利 我建议做个实验...
Leslie,I would like to propose an experiment...

110
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,445
- 戴上眼镜 谢尔顿 - 好吧
- goggles,leonard. - Right.

111
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,685
莱斯利 我建议做个实验
Leslie,I would like p toropose an experiment.

112
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:32,885
等一下
Hang on.

113
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:36,685
我想试试一个500千瓦氧碘激光器
I'm trying to see how long it takes a 500 - kilowatt oxygen iodine laser

114
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,845
得花多久把我的杯装泡面加热
to heat up my cup a' noodles.

115
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:42,935
我试过 大概2秒 蔬菜汤花2.6秒 
I've done it. About two seconds. 2. 6 for minestrone.

116
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:52,535
总之 我在考虑来个生物学的社交探索 
anyway,I was thinking more of a bio- social exploration

117
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,775
结合神经化学方面的专家知识
with a neuro- chemical overlay.

118
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:58,255
等等 你约我出去?
Wait,are you asking me out?

119
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:02,005
我认为是改变我们 
I was going to characterize it as the modification

120
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:04,525
同事/友谊关系的范例
of our colleague- slash- friendship paradigm

121
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:06,415
外加个约会作为补充成分
with the addition of a date like component,

122
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:10,025
但我们不需要一直说术语
but we don't need to quibble over terminology.

123
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:12,375
你计划做怎样的实验?
What sort of experiment would you propose?

124
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:15,405
这个领域有种普遍接受的模式
There's a generally accepted pattern in this area.

125
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:17,035
我去接你 带你去餐厅
I would pick you up,take you to a restaurant.

126
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,765
接着我们可以看场电影
Then we would see a movie,

127
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:21,685
也许一部休・格兰特或桑德拉・布洛克 
probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents

128
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:23,305
天才演绎的浪漫轻喜剧
of hugh grant or sandra bullock.

129
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:25,175
有意思
Interesting.

130
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,825
你是否同意  
And would you agree that the primary way

131
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:29,405
我们评价约会成败的依据
we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based

132
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:32,935
是基于离别之吻时的化学反应?
on the biochemical reaction during the good night kiss?

133
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:35,065
心跳率 生化信息素等等 的确
Heart rate,pheromones,etc. Yes.

134
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:39,535
我们干嘛不假定约会很顺利 直接进行关键的有变数的部分?
Why don't we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable?

135
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:41,005
你意思是现在就吻你?
You mean kiss you now?

136
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:41,975
是的
Yes.

137
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,685
你怎么定义吻的参数吗?
Can you define the parameters of the kiss?

138
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,535
嘴唇的亲密度还有浪漫度 要薄荷吗?
Close - mouthed but romantic. Mint?

139
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:47,045
谢谢
Thank you.

140
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:55,305
我数三下?
shall I count down from three?

141
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,925
不 我觉得应该自然点
No,I think it needs to be spontaneous.

142
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:06,045
感觉怎么样?
What do you think?

143
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:09,395
你提出的实验方案  该由你先说说实验的发现
You proposed the experiment. I think you should present your findings first.

144
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:11,725
很公平
Fair enough.

145
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:14,105
从正面讲 这个吻很不错
On the plus side,it was a good kiss.

146
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,615
合理的技术 没有多余的唾沫
Reasonable technique,no extraneous spittle.

147
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:20,365
另一方面讲 没什么感觉
On the other hand,no arousal.

148
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:22,975
- 没感觉? - 没有
- None? - None.

149
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:28,895
呃 很感谢你抽出时间
Well,thank you for your time.

150
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:30,525
谢谢你
Thank U.

151
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:36,545
一点感觉都没?
None at all?

152
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:46,045
谢尔顿 如果你是机器人 我知道但你自己不知道...
Sheldon,if you were a robot,and I knew and you didn'T... ...

153
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:50,125
你希望我告诉你吗?
would you want me to tell you?

154
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:53,195
看情况
That depends.

155
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:56,725
当我得知我是机器人...
When I learn that I'm a robot...

156
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:59,765
我有能力承受吗?
will I be able to handle it?

157
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:03,745
也许吧 虽然历来的科幻小说 都不能苟同这点
Maybe- - although the history of science fiction is not on your side.

158
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:07,005
好吧 我来问你
Okay,uh,let me ask you this- -

159
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:09,235
当我得知我是机器人
when I learn that I'm a robot,

160
00:08:09,245 --> 00:08:12,085
我要受限于阿西莫夫的"机器人三定律"吗?
would I be bound by asimov's three laws of robotics?

161
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:34,135
以下问题均出自"机器人三定律"

162
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:16,955
你可能现在就受限哦
You might be bound by them right now.

163
00:08:20,255 --> 00:08:21,395
就是啊
That's true.

164
00:08:21,405 --> 00:08:22,695
你伤害过人类吗?
Have you ever harmed a human being

165
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:24,955
或任人受伤而袖手旁观?
or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?

166
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:25,725
当然没有
Of course not.

167
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:28,455
除非在他人危险的情况下 你会伤害自己
Have you ever harmed yourself or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases

168
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:31,125
或容忍自己被伤害吗?
where a human being would have been endangered?

169
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,125
呃 没有
Well,no.

170
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:34,135
我闻到机器人的味道了 
I smell robot.

171
00:08:37,505 --> 00:08:38,645
嘿 过得怎么样?
Hey,what's going on?

172
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,105
互联网瘫痪半个小时了
Internet's been down for half an hour.

173
00:08:43,205 --> 00:08:45,675
还有 谢尔顿可能是机器人
Also,sheldon may be a robot.

174
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:49,435
和莱斯利怎么样啦?
So how'd it go with leslie?

175
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:53,995
哦 我们试着接吻 但地球没转
Oh,we tried kissing,but the earth didn't move.

176
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,275
我是说 比地球原来转的383英里要更多
I mean,any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.

177
00:09:00,765 --> 00:09:02,775
哦 我以前看过他这表情
Oh,I've seen that look before.

178
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:04,995
未来两周 他将不停地拖地
This is just going to be two weeks of moping

179
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:06,615
哼唱乏味的情感歌曲
and tedious emo songs

180
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,875
要我下去宠物商店看猫
and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats.

181
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:13,595
我不知道撑不撑得住
I don't know if I can take it.

182
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:16,435
你可以关掉自己的电源
You could power down.

183
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:21,855
一如既往 沃罗威茨会有解决办法的
Well,as usual,wolowitz has the solution.

184
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,585
我碰巧知道个好地方 有很多符合条件的女士
I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women

185
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:28,755
谢尔顿可以任意选
and leonard could have his pick.

186
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:40,365
记住拉丁舞的技巧
remember the latin hips.

187
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,645
肩膀挺直 然后摇摆
Shoulders stay still,and... we sway.

188
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,715
一 二 三...
One,two,three... ...

189
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:53,855
五 六 七
five,six,seven.

190
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,715
q诗曼女士一直盯着你呢
I think mrs. Tishman's got her eye on you.

191
00:09:57,735 --> 00:09:59,785
我有过经验 你会喜欢的
I've been there. You're in for a treat.

192
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:09,865
"她说 你不了解我"
She said,"you don't know me"

193
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:14,355
"你甚至不在乎"
"you don't even care"

194
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,245
"哦 耶"
oh,yeah...

195
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:17,445
哦 上帝
oh,good lord.

196
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:20,815
"她说 你不了解我"
She said,"you don't know me"

197
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:25,965
"你不戴我送你的项链"
"you don't wear my chains"

198
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:29,805
"哦 耶" 天啊 这歌真棒
oh,yeah. God,that's a good song.

199
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:33,785
当然 如果这是你为双重自杀混合录制的Cd
If you're compiling a mix cd for a double suicide.

200
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:37,825
我希望那"猫抓柱"是你自己用的
Oh,I hope that scratching post is for you.

201
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:41,385
我知道你在想什么 你的哮喘病我有考虑在内
I know what you're thinking. I've taken your asthma into account.

202
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:43,575
圣地亚哥有个研究猫科的遗传学家
There's a feline geneticist in san diego

203
00:10:43,585 --> 00:10:46,655
培育了一种超可爱的低变应原小猫
who's developed the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos.

204
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:47,645
谢尔顿 听我说...
Leonard,listen to me...

205
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:48,785
我在想给它起什么名字
I've been thinking about names.

206
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:52,845
在爱因斯坦 牛顿和毛靴中士之间犹豫
I'm kind of torn between einstein,newton and sergeant fuzzy boots.

207
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:55,965
谢尔顿 你真认为养一只转基因猫
Leonard,do you really think you can satisfy your need

208
00:10:55,985 --> 00:10:58,765
可以满足你的感情需要吗?
for a relationshh witip a genetically altered cat?

209
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:00,585
也许
Maybe.

210
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:03,185
一只让人爱不释手的可爱小猫
If it's a cute,little,cuddly cat.

211
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,555
得了吧 谢尔顿...
Oh,come on. Leonard...

212
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:09,805
这都是因为佩妮吧
this is obviously about penny.

213
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,325
没所谓
It doesn't matter.

214
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:16,225
她对我不感兴趣 拒绝了我
The woman's not interested in me. The woman rejected me.

215
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:17,525
好吧 听着 
Okay,look,

216
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:23,155
我认为你能跟佩妮做爱的几率
I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with penny

217
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:26,455
跟哈勃太空望远镜 发现在每个黑洞中央 
as the hubble telescope does of discovering at the center of every black hole

218
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:30,275
都有个小人在用闪光灯 寻找断路器的几率一样大
is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker.

219
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:34,715
尽管如此
Nevertheless,

220
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:39,575
我还是有责任向你指出 她并没有拒绝你
I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did not reject you.

221
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,325
你从没邀请她去约会
You did not ask her out.

222
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:45,275
你说的对
You're right.

223
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:47,295
我没请她约会过 我该去请她约会
I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.

224
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,525
不不不 重点不是这个
No,no,now that was not my point.

225
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:52,575
重点是 不要养猫
My point was don't buy a cat.

226
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:55,185
不 你是对的
No,but you're right.

227
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:57,695
我该过去请她约会
I should march over there and ask her out.

228
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:00,765
天 我们要养猫了
Oh,goody,we're getting a cat.

229
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,965
啊...不
Uh... no.

230
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:09,075
你好 谢尔顿
Oh,hey,leonard.

231
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:11,655
下午好 佩妮 嗨 你好
Good afternoon,penny. So,hi... hey.

232
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,565
呃...
Uh...

233
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,985
你约了人吃饭吗?
I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.

234
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:17,695
今晚的饭?
Uh,you mean dinner tonight?

235
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:21,245
"饭"这个词本身就意思含糊
There is an inherent ambiguity in the word "dinner.

236
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:24,755
严格说来它所指的是一日的主餐  可以是午餐或晚餐
" Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it's consumed.

237
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:27,345
为了说清楚 我指的是晚饭
So to clarify here,by dinner I mean supper.

238
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:29,255
- 晚饭? - 就是吃饭啦
- Supper? - Or dinner.

239
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:33,295
如果你有空 6点半行吗? 或者其他你方便的时间
I was thinking 6:30 if you can go. Or a different time.

240
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:34,895
6点半可以啊
Uh,6:30's great.

241
00:12:34,905 --> 00:12:36,505
真的?
Really?

242
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:38,905
太好了
Great.

243
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:40,575
我喜欢跟你们一起玩
Yeah,I like hanging out with you guys.

244
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:41,665
我们?
Us guys?

245
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:44,715
对 谢尔顿 霍华德 拉杰 他们都一起吧?
Yeah,you know,sheldon,howard,raj. Who all's coming?

246
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:49,605
他们...可能都会去吧
They... might all be there.

247
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:53,865
或者他们中的有些人可能去
Or a subset of them might be there.

248
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,485
从代数角度看 太多未知数了
Algebraically speaking,there are too many unknowns.

249
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:58,725
比如 谢尔顿中午吃了Quizno三明治
For example,sheldon had quiznos for lunch.

250
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:01,185
有时他觉得吃那个饱 有时候不觉得
Sometimes he finds that filling,other times he doesn'T.

251
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:04,285
这不是店家的错 他们的菜单很丰盛
It's no fault of quiznos- - they have a varied menu.

252
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:08,325
好吧 无所谓啦 听起来挺有意思的
Okay,whatever. It sounds like fun.

253
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:11,245
很好 我们约时间了吗?
Great. Did we say a time?

254
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:12,105
6点半
6:30.

255
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:13,905
- 你确定那时有空? - 对
- And that's still good for you? - It's fine.

256
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:16,615
- 不是刻在石板上非得那时去哦 - 6点半正好
- 'Cause it's not carved in stone. - No,6:30's great.

257
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,835
我去拿凿子
I'll get my chisel.

258
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:21,245
为什么?
Why?

259
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:26,805
去刻在石...6点半见
To... carve the... I'll see you at 6:30.

260
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:39,795
我看起来如何?
How do I look?

261
00:13:44,285 --> 00:13:46,225
你能说具体一点吗?
Could you be more specific?

262
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:50,015
能看出来我在冒汗吗?
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?

263
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:52,105
不能
No.

264
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:55,745
你腋下深色的新月状图案 将其隐藏的很好
The dark crescent shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.

265
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:58,785
你几点约会?
What time is your date?

266
00:13:58,795 --> 00:13:59,765
6点半
6:30.

267
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:02,595
太好了 那你还有2小时15分
Perfect. That gives you two hours and 15 minutes for

268
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:05,355
让那片稠密的人造纤维分子云消散
that dense molecular cloud of aramis to dissipate.

269
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:07,605
汗很多吗?
Is it too much?

270
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,785
如果你是橄榄球队员就不算多
Not if you're a rugby team.

271
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:13,655
如果以后提到今晚的事 你没来参加的原因是
By the way,if it should ever come up,you didn't join us

272
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:16,725
你在Quiznos吃鸡肉三明治吃撑了
because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at quiznos.

273
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:19,115
我为什么要去参加?
Why would I join you?

274
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,035
不为什么
No reason.

275
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:25,845
你知道吗 也许这样做不好
Oh,you know what,maybe this isn't such a good idea.

276
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:30,285
不 酒精加上她一时糊涂
Oh,no,well,now there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgment

277
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,955
总有可能让今晚成为浪漫之夜
on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.

278
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:37,575
你说的对 酒 糊涂 今晚有可能会顺利的
You're right. Alcohol,poor judgment- - it could go well.

279
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,925
当然还有另一种可能性
Of course there is the other possibility,

280
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:42,655
之后的6个月都会很难捱
that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months

281
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,405
俩人在走廊里尴尬的擦身而过
of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall,

282
00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:47,065
直到其中一人崩溃并搬到别的州去
until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.

283
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:50,485
你说到"可能会顺利"就可以闭嘴了
You could've stopped at "it could go well.

284
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:54,355
"如果我能 我会的"
" If I could've,I would've.

285
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,435
我是绝种好男人
I mean,I'm a perfectly nice guy.

286
00:14:56,775 --> 00:15:00,025
没理由我们不能 在餐厅吃好顿晚餐
There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant,and have a lovely dinner,

287
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:04,535
饭后散散步 聊些共同话题
maybe take a walk afterwards,talk about things we have in common.

288
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:08,165
"你喜欢陶艺? 我超爱陶艺的!"
You love pottery? I love pottery!

289
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,935
然后暂停一下 我们都知道接下来要发生什么
There's a pause,we both know what's happening.

290
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:11,985
我倾身向前 我俩接吻
I lean in,we kiss.

291
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,925
开始时还有点犹豫 然后她开始回吻我
It's a little tentative at first,but then I realize she's kissing me back.

292
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:17,205
她在咬我的下唇! 她想要我!
She's biting my lower lip! She wants me!

293
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:19,265
这事能成!我们会做爱!
This thing is going the distance! We're going to have sex!

294
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:21,435
天 上帝啊!
Oh,god,oh,my god!

295
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:25,695
现在开始做爱了?
Is the sex starting now?

296
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:28,005
我恐慌症发作了
I'm having a panic attack.

297
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:30,795
好吧 冷静点
Oh,okay. Uh,well then... calm down.

298
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:33,595
如果我能冷静 就不会恐慌了! 
If I could calm down,I wobe having a panic att...

299
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:35,275
不然这怎么叫做恐慌症发作!
that's why they call it a panic attack.

300
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:37,665
好好 你坐下
All right,all right. Uh,s- s- sit down.

301
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,155
坐下 闭上眼
Yeah,sit down. Now close your eyes.

302
00:15:40,165 --> 00:15:41,315
- 为什么? - 照做吧!
- Why? - Just do it.

303
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:42,025
好
Okay.

304
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:45,315
α波是脑电图中最著名的一种波在正常成年人闭眼放松时产生

305
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:45,315
试着增加你α波的活性 
Now try to increase your alpha wave activity.

306
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,195
什么? !
What? !

307
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:48,365
这是机能反馈疗法
It's a biofeedback technique.

308
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,205
通过控制脑电波来放松
It's relaxation through brain wave manipulation.

309
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,005
我在美国神经科学月刊上 看到一篇关于它的论文
I read a paper about it in journal of american neuroscience.

310
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:55,815
它的理论来源不完备 但是我认为基本原理正确
It was a little sparsely sourced,but I think the basic science is valid.

311
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:58,515
我可能把它放在这了
I probably have it here somewher E.

312
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,285
我没法赴这个约会
Who am I kidding? I can't go through with this.

313
00:16:00,295 --> 00:16:01,865
你给她打电话取消吧
You need to call her and cancel.

314
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,735
- 我? - 对
- Me? - Yes.

315
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:04,995
- 我要跟她说什么? - 我不知道
- What should I tell her? - I don't know.

316
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,735
- 跟她说我病了 - 好
- Tell her I'm sick. - Okay.

317
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:09,405
别说那种会让她想来照顾我的病
Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me,

318
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:12,995
也不要严重得让她 以后不愿跟我约会的病
but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future

319
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,075
如果我以后还想尝试的话
if I want to try this again.

320
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:15,225
了解
Got it.

321
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,005
那不能说花柳病啦?
So I'm assuming nothing venereal?

322
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:24,985
就跟她说你做了例行肠镜检查 还没恢复吧
I'll just tell her that you had a routine conoloscopy and haven't quite bounced back.

323
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,245
给我电话
Give me the phone.

324
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:28,535
你不是想取消约会吗?
I thought you wanted to cancel.

325
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:31,225
不行 如果我不出现 她还是会认为你会去的
I can't,because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.

326
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:33,605
为什么她认为我会去?
Why would she be expecting me?

327
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:38,075
别问了 我要再去洗个澡
Stop asking me all these questions. I need to take another shower.

328
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:43,955
其他的人直接来这找我们?
So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?

329
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:46,015
对...不对
Oh,yeah... no.

330
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:50,255
拉杰跟霍华德要工作 谢尔顿...
It turns out that raj and howard had to work,and sheldon...

331
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:54,205
做了肠镜 还没恢复过来
had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.

332
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,075
我叔叔也做了肠镜
Oh,my uncle just had a colonoscopy.

333
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:01,575
这就是我们俩的共同之处了
You're kidding. Then that's something we have in common.

334
00:17:02,665 --> 00:17:04,345
怎么说?
How?

335
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:07,375
我们都认识...
We both have people in our lives who...

336
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:10,825
想将肠道息肉扼杀于摇篮当中的人
want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.

337
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:19,525
物理界有啥新闻不?
so what's new in the world of physics?

338
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,905
没有
Nothing.

339
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,215
真的? 一点都没有?
Really? Nothing?

340
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:29,895
除了弦理论 自1930年后就没什么发现了
Well,with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930s.

341
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:31,815
而弦理论也尚未证明
And you can't prove string theory.

342
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:33,585
最多就能说
At best you can say,"hey,look,

343
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:37,355
"嘿 我的理论内部逻辑很连贯"
my idea has an internal logical consistency.

344
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,785
啊
" Ah.

345
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:41,955
我相信情况会好转的
Well,I'm sure things will pick up.

346
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:48,435
芝士蛋糕工厂那边有什么新消息?
What's new at the cheesecake factory?

347
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,975
没有什么
Oh,uh,not much.

348
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:54,585
有个巧克力柠檬派卖得很好
We do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well.

349
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:58,565
很好
Good. Good.

350
00:18:01,905 --> 00:18:04,445
那你那个...
What about your,uh...

351
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:06,265
过道上的朋友怎样?
hallway friend?

352
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:08,805
道格? 我不知道
Doug? Oh,yeah,I don't know.

353
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:10,925
他人挺好也很风趣 但是...
I mean,you know,he's nice and funny,but...

354
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:11,935
准备开始点饮品了吗?
can I get you started with some drinks?

355
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:13,755
不!
No!

356
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:16,425
- 你刚刚说到? 但是... - 我想喝点东西
- You were saying? But... - I'd like a drink.

357
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:19,325
先说完关于道格的"但是" 我会把她叫回来
Just say the "but" thing about doug and then I'll get her back.

358
00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:23,555
我不知道 是我的问题
Okay,well,I don't know,it's just me.

359
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:25,995
我还没从跟科特的分手中完全恢复
I'm still getting over this breakup with kurt

360
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,755
跟道格在一起是为了复健性爱
and this thing with doug would stju be rebound sex.

361
00:18:29,225 --> 00:18:32,585
噢 提起复健性爱啊...
Oh,don't get me started on rebound sex.

362
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:35,445
我总是这样
It's just... it's my pattern.

363
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:37,845
分手后找个帅哥
I break up,then I find some cute guy,

364
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:41,775
然后就是36小时毫无意义的...
and then it's just 36 meaningless hours of...

365
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:43,755
你知道
you know.

366
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:46,865
我不确定我知道
I'm not sure that I do.

367
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:51,135
是连续36个小时
is that one 36-hour experience,

368
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:53,725
还是一个辉煌夏季中...
or is that 36 hours spread out over,say...

369
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:56,205
分散的36个小时?
one glorious summer?

370
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:57,985
不 大概是一个周末吧
No,it's usually over a weekend,

371
00:18:57,995 --> 00:19:00,685
相信我 那之后感觉很不好
and trust me,you do not feel good after it.

372
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:03,265
呃 皮肤疼痛是吧?
Well,chafing,right?

373
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:05,645
心情不好
Emotionally.

374
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:08,125
没错 心里疼痛
Of course,yeah,emotional chafing.

375
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,855
你想看些有趣的玩意吗?
Hey,do you want to see something cool?

376
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:23,515
我不用手碰 就能把这颗橄榄弄进杯子里
I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it.

377
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:26,425
- 怎么弄啊? - 物理原理
- How? - Physics.

378
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:34,005
哇 离心力
Wow,centrifugal force.

379
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,345
实际上 是向心力
Actually,it's centripetal force,

380
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:40,515
玻璃对橄榄作用产生的内向力
which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive...

381
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:43,265
抱歉
Excuse me.

382
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:46,295
如果你坐在那颗橄榄上
If you were riding on the olive,

383
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:49,565
你就是一个非惯性参照系 并会...
you'd be in a non - inertial reference frame and would...

384
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:52,445
你没事吧?
are you okay?

385
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:54,155
没事
Yeah,I'm okay.

386
00:19:55,315 --> 00:19:56,995
你打翻花生酱了吗?
Did you spill ketchup?

387
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:59,195
- 没 - 那有事了
- No. - I'm not okay.

388
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,430
你确定不用去急诊室?
Are you sure you don't want to go to the emergency room?

389
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,400
我没事 不流血了 
No,no,I'm okay. It stopped bleeding.

390
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,320
但你吐了啊  那不是脑震荡的症状吗?
I know,but you did throw up. Isn't that a sign of a concussion?

391
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,290
对 但我也晕车 所以...
Yes. But I get car sick,too,so...

392
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,370
好吧
okay.

393
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,030
还有 抱歉弄脏你的车
Sorry about your car,by the way.

394
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,720
没关系 大部分你都吐车外了
Oh,no,it's fine. You got most of it out the window.

395
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,660
那个骑自行车的可怜人
The poor guy on the bike.

396
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,280
我今晚过得很愉快
Well,I had a nice time.

397
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,100
我也是
Yeah,me,too.

398
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,530
那晚安啦
Well,um,good night.

399
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,480
晚安
Good night.

400
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,010
- 谢尔顿? - 啊?
