1
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:05,886
不  你想  液态金属终结者  
No, see, the liquid-metal terminators were created

2
00:00:05,946 --> 00:00:07,546
是天网系统在未来世界创造的角色
In the future by skynet,

3
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:09,416
而天网系统是由麦尔斯・戴森开发的
And skynet was developed by miles dyson,

4
00:00:09,486 --> 00:00:11,086
但这样的未来不会存在了
But that future no longer exists

5
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:13,516
因为戴森已经在终结者2里死了
Due to dyson's death in terminator 2.

6
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:15,896
好吧  但你这样想
Okay,read only this.

7
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:17,966
假设所有正义的终结者一开始
Assuming all the good terminators

8
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:21,046
由天网系统创造时都是邪恶的
Were originally evil terminators created by skynet

9
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:23,016
是后来经约翰・康纳之手才重新改编了其程序
But then reprogrammed by the future john connor,

10
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:26,116
那为什么天网系统  如此一个人工智能
Why would skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,

11
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:30,036
会去创造一个火辣的17岁小矮个机器人杀手?
Bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year-old killer robot?

12
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:34,016
因为天网系统变态?
Skynet is kinky?

13
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:35,426
我不知道
I don't know...

14
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:38,796
人工智能可不会把小屁孩当恋物
Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.

15
00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:40,586
好吧  等等  其实他们是想用它...
All right. Wait! they use it to...

16
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:42,516
太晚了  我赢了
Too late. I win.

17
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:59,706
这究竟是什么玩意?
What the hell is that?

18
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,526
我不知道  但如果猫可以唱歌
I don't know, but if cats could sing...

19
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,916
它们也会受不了这个
They'd hate it, too.

20
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,896
好啊  伙计们
Hey, guys!

21
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:18,386
你们去哪儿?
Hi! where you going?

22
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,376
什么
What?

23
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:24,276
我们出去寄些信  还有...
We just had to mail some letters and...

24
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:26,566
顺便把这些鸡肉扔了
Throw away some chicken.

25
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:45,216
你们肯定猜不到刚才发生了什么
You'll never guess what just happened.

26
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,246
我猜不到
Oh, I give up.

27
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,246
我根本不用猜
I don't guess.

28
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,786
作为一名科学家  我们通过
As a scientist, I reach conclusions

29
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:51,376
观察和试验来得出结论...
Based on observation and experimentation...

30
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:52,816
虽然我现在正这么说
Although as I'm saying this,

31
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:54,746
但我感觉你可能已经使用了
It occurs to me you may have been employing

32
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:57,516
某种能带修辞的表达装置来使我的回应倍受争议
A rhetorical device rendering my response moot.

33
00:01:58,346 --> 00:01:59,516
那是什么东西?
What was that?

34
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,716
你信不信  他现在开窍了
Believe it or not, personal growth.

35
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:02,776
是什么事?
What happened?

36
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:04,486
是这样  记不记得我曾经参加了
All right, remember when I auditioned for that workshop

37
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:06,106
出租产品展示会的试镜却没通过
Production of rent, but I didn't get it

38
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:07,246
并且我没想通是什么原因?
And I couldn't figure out why.

39
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:09,346
通过观察我得出了一点结论
I have a conclusion based on an observation.

40
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,546
不  你没有
No, you don't.

41
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:12,346
不  他没有
No, he doesn't.

42
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,026
他们选中的那个女孩
Well, the girl they picked to play mimi--

43
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:16,106
她退出了  然后他们让我替代她
She dropped out, and they asked me to replace her.

44
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:18,136
恭喜你  这是个契机啊
Congratulations. what a lucky break.

45
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:20,046
没什么大不了的  就一晚上的亮相
It's not that big a deal, just a one-night showcase,

46
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:22,386
但他们请了好多剧组人员和经纪人来
But they invite a lot of casting people and agents.

47
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:23,486
去了才知道啦...
So, you never know.

48
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:25,366
-我想我知道  -不  你不知道
I think I know. no, you don't.

49
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:27,546
他不知道
He doesn't.

50
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:29,516
这周五晚8点  你们想不想来?
It's this friday night at 8:00. you guys want to come?

51
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:30,986
-不  -不
No. no.

52
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:34,216
因为...
Because... uh...

53
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:37,446
周五我们要参加一个
Friday we are attending a symposium

54
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:39,116
关于分子正负的研讨会
On molecular positronium.

55
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:40,716
我以为是下周二6点呢
I think that's a week from tuesday,at 6:00.

56
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:42,796
不  是这个周五
No, it's this friday.

57
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,646
8点
At 8:00.

58
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:45,786
太遗憾了
Oh, too bad.

59
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:46,906
好了  我得去排练了
Well, I gotta get to rehearsal.

60
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,506
-再见了  伙计们  -再见
See you guys. see ya.

61
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:55,386
你刚才对潘妮撒了谎
You just lied to penny.

62
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:57,146
-是  我撒了谎  -而且你表现得
Yes, I did. and you did it

63
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:58,616
如此从容  没有呼吸急促
So casually-- no rapid breathing,

64
00:02:58,616 --> 00:03:00,456
也没有冒汗
No increase in perspiration...

65
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:01,486
所以说?
So?

66
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:04,416
所以说  你撒谎时缺乏生理反应
So, lack of a physiological response while lying

67
00:03:04,486 --> 00:03:07,306
这是反社会暴力狂的特点
Is characteristic of a violent sociopath.

68
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:09,556
谢尔顿  你是在担心你的人身安全吗
Sheldon, are you worried about your safety?

69
00:03:09,586 --> 00:03:11,626
不  我想如果你要杀了我
No, I imagine if you were going to kill me,

70
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,586
你早就下手了
You'd have done it a long time ago.

71
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:16,256
说得非常正确
That's very true.

72
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:56,236
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第10集
The.Loobenfeld.Decay

73
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:04,385
莱纳德
Leonard?

74
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,585
莱纳德
Leonard?

75
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,915
-莱纳德  -干嘛
Leonard? what?

76
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:11,515
我得找你谈谈
I need to speak to you.

77
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,225
现在是凌晨2点
It's 2:00 in the morning!

78
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:14,225
很重要的事
It's important.

79
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:16,855
我严重怀疑
I highly doubt that.

80
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:18,555
走开
Go away.

81
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:24,495
你还在外面吗
Are you still out there?

82
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,115
没错
Yes.

83
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:30,245
干嘛
What?

84
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:33,545
你说的对  我们还是天亮了再说吧
You're right; it can wait until morning.

85
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:36,945
什么  什么  什么  什么  什么
What, what, what, what, what?

86
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:38,315
没事儿
Never mind.

87
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:41,015
很明显我在你熟睡的时候叫醒了你
I clearly woke you up in the middle of a rem cycle.

88
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:42,645
你根本就没心情听我说话
You're in no state of mind to talk.

89
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,635
谢尔顿  到底什么事
Sheldon, what is it?

90
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:49,645
卷入了你对潘妮的欺骗事件我感到很不舒服
I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to penny.

91
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:51,445
那我应该怎么说
What was I supposed to say?

92
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:52,815
你可以跟她说实话
You could have told her the truth.

93
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:54,845
那样会伤害她的
That would have hurt her feelings.

94
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:57,915
这跟伤害她有什么关系?
Is that a relevant factor?

95
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,315
当然有
Yes.

96
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:01,545
那我想你应该答应她去的
Then I suppose you could've agreed to go.

97
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:04,165
那我之后该怎么说?
And what would I have said afterwards?

98
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:06,355
我会这么说
I would suggest something to be a fact of

99
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:08,585
唱歌对你来说既不是一个合适的职业
Singing is neither an appropriate vocation

100
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:11,045
也不是合适的副业  如果你不同意
Nor avocation for you, and if you disagree,

101
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:12,535
我建议你去做一个X光断层扫描
I'd recommend you have a cat scan

102
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:13,615
看看是不是有肿瘤
To look for a tumor pressing

103
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:16,365
压迫到了你大脑的认知处理单元
On the cognitive processing centers of your brain.

104
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:19,405
我可说不出来
I couldn't say that.

105
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:21,345
我只会说  你真的太棒了
I would have to say, "you were terrific

106
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:23,845
我好想再听一遍你的歌声
And I can't wait to hear you sing again."

107
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:26,185
为什么
Why?

108
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:28,295
这是人们交际的法则
That's the social protocol.

109
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,615
当你朋友对自己很烂的东西引以为傲时
It's what you do when you have a friend

110
00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:32,775
你就应该这么做
Who's proud of something they really suck at.

111
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,485
我以前不知道
I was not aware of that.

112
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:37,115
那你现在知道了
Well, now you are. oh.

113
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:38,845
好吧  莱纳德
All right. leonard?

114
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:39,735
怎么
Yes?

115
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,225
记得我们以前玩国际象棋吗
When we played chess earlier,

116
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:43,735
你真的太棒了  我真想能有机会再跟你切磋
You were terrific, and I can't wait to play you again.

117
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:45,275
晚安
Good night.

118
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:50,565
莱纳德
Leonard?

119
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:51,705
莱纳德
Leonard?

120
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:52,845
莱纳德
Leonard?

121
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:55,785
如果我真是反社会暴力狂
This would be so much easier

122
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:58,045
那就好办多了
If I were a violent sociopath.

123
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:00,515
莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard? leonard?

124
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:01,985
怎么了
What?

125
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:04,945
我刚才分析了下我们的谎话  我在想
I was analyzing our lie, and I believe we're in danger

126
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:07,015
潘妮要是看穿了我们的骗局  我们就危险了
Of penny seeing through the ruse.

127
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:08,415
怎么会
How?

128
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:10,115
很简单  如果她登陆
Simple, If she were to log onto

129

And look for the seminar on molecular positronium,

133
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:21,485
那可好了
Well than...

134
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,185
我们就要火烧屁股了
Our pants are metaphorically on fire.

135
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:32,615
好吧  先生  我今天不会让火烧到我屁股的
Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.

136
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:36,385
潘妮
Penny?

137
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:37,585
潘妮	
Penny?

138
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:38,985
潘妮
Penny?

139
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:41,505
早上好
Good morning.

140
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:43,385
你知不知道现在几点?
Do you have any idea what time it is?

141
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,555
我当然知道
Of course I do.

142
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:46,115
我的手表连接着科罗拉多州的
My watch is linked to the atomic clock

143
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:48,415
波尔得的原子钟
In boulder, colorado.

144
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:50,685
精确到0.1秒
It's accurate to one-tenth of a second.

145
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:53,015
但我在这说话的同时  再一次
But as I'm saying this, it occurs to me

146
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:55,915
我感觉你的问题可能是带修辞性的
That, once again, your question may have been rhetorical.

147
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:57,545
你要干什么
What do you want?

148
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:58,815
还记得莱纳德怎么跟你说
Remember how leonard told you

149
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,085
为什么我们不能去看你表演吗
We couldn't come to your performance

150
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:01,915
因为我们要参加研讨会
Because we were attending a symposium

151
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:03,785
关于分子正负的
On molecular positronium?

152
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:08,185
我记得有个研讨会
I remember "symposium."

153
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:11,145
是的  那是他骗你的
Yes. well... he lied.

154
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:12,345
等等
Wait.

155
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,415
什么
What?

156
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:14,415
他跟你撒谎了
He lied

157
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:16,845
我对此感到很忐忑不安
And I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.

158
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:19,085
知道我是什么感觉吗
Well, imagine how I'm feeling.

159
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:22,325
饿?
Hungry?

160
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:25,175
累?
Tired?

161
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:27,835
对不起  这真的不是我的强项
I'm sorry, this really isn't my strong suit.

162
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:30,855
你告诉他我骗她?
You told her I lied?

163
00:07:30,855 --> 00:07:32,715
你为什么要告诉她我骗她?
Why would you tell her I lied?

164
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:34,795
为了帮你
To help you.

165
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:37,795
不好意思  我没看到哪里有帮助
I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.

166
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:40,285
她最终肯定会看穿你的谎言
She was going to see through your lie eventually,

167
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:43,405
所以  为了保护我  我告诉她你撒了谎
So I told her that you were lying to protect me.

168
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:46,495
我有种不好的感觉
Ohh... I'm getting a bad feeling.

169
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:48,345
饿了?
Hunger?

170
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,495
消化不良?
Indigestion?

171
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:53,065
对不起  我真的不擅长这个
I'm sorry, I'm really not very good at this.

172
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:54,035
总之
Anyway,

173
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:56,115
潘妮现在已经相信
Penny now believes that, on friday night,

174
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,415
周五的晚上我们要去参加
We're going to participate

175
00:07:57,485 --> 00:08:00,525
我表弟里奥珀德的戒毒调停会
In my cousin leopold's drug intervention.

176
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:03,645
你的表弟里奥珀德
Your cousin leopold.

177
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:05,845
大部分人叫他里奥  但你叫他里他也会答应
Who most people call leo, but he also answers to lee.

178
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:07,415
记住这点  这很关键
Remember that. it's important.

179
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:08,935
有什么好关键的?
What's important?

180
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:10,585
细节  莱纳德
Details, leonard-- the success

181
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:12,245
骗人的成功或失败
Or failure of our deceitful enterprise

182
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:14,275
就是取决于细节
Turns on details.

183
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:16,215
-你真有个表弟叫里奥珀德?  -没有
Do you have a cousin leopold? no.

184
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:17,515
他是我捏造的
I made him up.

185
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:21,145
我觉得你应该叫他里
I think you'd call him lee.

186
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:22,315
我不明白了
I don't get it.

187
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:23,845
我已经跟她撒过一次谎了
I already told her a lie.

188
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:26,685
为什么要再撒一个不同的谎?
Why replace it with a different lie?

189
00:08:26,745 --> 00:08:29,015
首先  你的谎话很可笑且容易被识破
Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent,

190
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:31,445
而我的却十分缜密且难以识破
Where mine is exquisitely convoluted.

191
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:33,765
在你睡觉的时候
While you were sleeping,

192
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:37,255
我组建了一个"非不可解释"网站
I was weaving an un-unravelable web.

193
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:38,795
非不可解释?
Un-unravelable?

194
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:39,745
是的
Yes.

195
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:41,615
如果她在Google里搜索"里奥珀德・休斯顿"
If she googles "leopold houston,"

196
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:43,005
她会找到一个Facebook(美国交友网站)页面
She'll find a facebook page,

197
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:45,345
一个在线博客  里面有描述他吸毒走向堕落的过程
An online blog depicting his descent into drug use

198
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:49,285
而且在Eharmony.com(美国婚介网站)有个绝望但仍有希望的名单
And a desperate yet hopeful listing on eharmony.com.

199
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:52,015
好吧  但是为什么
Okay, why would I go

200
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:54,245
我要去参加你表弟的戒毒调停会
To a drug intervention for your cousin?

201
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:57,485
因为那在长滩  而我又不会开车
Ah! because it's in long beach, and I don't drive.

202
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:00,115
我们要去长滩?
We're going to long beach?

203
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:01,785
不  当然不  根本就没有表弟里奥
No, of course not. there's no cousin leo.

204
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:02,985
也没有调停会
There's no intervention.

205
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:04,285
动动脑子  莱纳德
Focus, leonard.

206
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:05,315
不会吧
Aw, come on.

207
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:09,205
我们只需要在周五晚上离开家
We just leave the house on friday night and we return

208
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:11,265
然后等到凌晨再回来
In the wee hours, emotionally wrung out,

209
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:14,285
带着一幅坚信里奥回戒毒所后能改邪归正的表情
From the work of convincing leo to go back into rehab.

210
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:15,315
他还要回戒毒所?
He goes back into rehab?

211
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:17,945
没错  并且  要是潘妮再邀请我们听她唱歌
Yes, but, he can relapse if penny

212
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,085
他随时可以毒瘾发作的
Ever invites us to hear her sing again.

213
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,745
你毕竟还是告诉她我撒谎了
You still told her I lied.

214
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,515
但初衷很高尚的  你是为了帮助我 
For a noble purpose-- to spare me

215
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:27,645
避免让人知道我有个吸毒的弟弟
The social embarrassment

216
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:29,915
这一让人尴尬的事情
Of having a drug-addled first cousin--

217
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:32,415
我假设这是很尴尬  对吗
Which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?

218
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:36,285
我怎么可能记住这么多乱七八糟的
How am I supposed to remember all of this?

219
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:37,885
最精彩的部分到了  你根本不用去记  
Oh, that's the best part. you don't have to.

220
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,845
我对潘妮说如果你发现
See, I told penny that you would be embarrassed

221
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:42,085
她知道你骗她的话  你会很尴尬
If you knew that she found out that you had lied,

222
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:43,485
所以  她同意装作像上个谎话
So she's agreed to operate

223
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:46,285
还没被拆穿一样  装作什么都不知道
As if the original lie is still in force.

224
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:51,145
所以她以为我是撒谎
So she's expecting me to lie about going

225
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,485
说去帕萨迪纳市开研讨会
To a symposium in pasadena,

226
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:55,285
而实际上  我们假装正要去
When, in actuality, we're pretending

227
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,615
长滩参加你弟弟的戒毒调停会
To go to a drug intervention in long beach.

228
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,715
非不可解释
Un-unravelable.

229
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:06,144
潘妮
Oh, hey, penny.

230
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:08,684
你看看你  都整装待发准备好演出了
Wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase.

231
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:10,000
-你看上去真漂亮  -谢谢
You look great. thanks.

232
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:12,471
我只是想过来看看并且祝你们好运
I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck

233
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:14,331
关于你们的...研讨会
With your... symposium.

234
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,091
谢谢你
Well, thank you.

235
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:19,671
我必须要跟你说  很多人都会
You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends

236
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:21,091
让他们的朋友孤零零一个人
Would let their friend go alone,

237
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:22,191
但你不是这样的人
But that's not who you are.

238
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:25,171
你是那种总陪在朋友身边的人
You are the kind of guy who stands by a friend

239
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:29,291
即使当他有个...研讨会要去参加
When... when he has a symposium to go to.

240
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:34,789
我不知道怎么说
I don't know what to say.

241
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:36,739
没事的  莱纳德
It's okay, leonard.

242
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:38,779
哦  好的  不错
Oh, okay, all right, good.

243
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,569
伙计  大家一起来抱抱
Oh, boy, group hug. uh-uh.

244
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,369
好吧
Okay.

245
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:45,639
怎么了?
So, what's up?

246
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,759
潘妮正要去一个
Well, penny is on her way to perform

247
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,009
出租用品展示会进行表演
In a one-night showcase production of rent,

248
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:52,069
而我们不能去了  因为我们要去参加
Which we are unable to attend, because we're going

249
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:54,869
由伊米尔・法尔曼法尔米安博士主讲的
To a symposium on molecular positronium

250
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:57,669
关于分子正负的研讨会
Given by dr. emil farmanfarmian.

251
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,629
等等  法尔曼法尔米安要来
Wait a minute-- farmanfarmian is speaking

252
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:01,699
而你们竟然霸占这个研讨会?
And you're bogarting the symposium?

253
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:03,599
霍华德  对不...我们...
Howard, I'm sorr... we-we...

254
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:06,119
不  不  你们保密到连夸克都透不过
No, no, you're quark-blocking us.

255
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:11,009
我不知道怎么说
I don't know what to say.

256
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,769
-霍华德  听着...  -不  没关系
Howard, listen... no, it's okay.

257
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,039
那是你的命根子
It's your millennium falcon.

258
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:17,089
你可以跟楚巴卡(体型高大、身披毛发的战士)得到任何你们想要的
You and chewbacca do whatever you want to do.

259
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:19,869
我跟莱娅公主(星战人物)
Me and princess leia here

260
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:22,139
会找点别的事来度过今晚
Will find some other way to spend the evening.

261
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,299
霍华德  等等
Howard, wait. wai...

262
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:27,369
谢尔顿  我觉得我们得告诉他们
Sheldon, I think we should tell them.

263
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:29,939
好吧  当然可以
Okay, sure.

264
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:32,439
我觉得没有任何问题
I don't see a problem with that.

265
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:34,099
根本就没有什么研讨会
There's no symposium.

266
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:36,769
莱纳德跟我撒了谎  是不是  莱纳德?
Leonard lied to me. isn't that right, leonard?

267
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,059
我不知道怎么说
I don't know what to say!

268
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:43,389
没关系  我来说
It's okay; I do.

269
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:45,969
莱纳德其实在帮谢尔顿解决家庭危机
Look, leonard is helping sheldon through a family crisis.

270
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,469
他编了整个什么研讨会的故事
He made up the whole story about the symposium

271
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:50,619
什么法尔曼...法尔米安...博士
With dr. farman... farmian...

272
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:52,379
你真强
Good for you.

273
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:55,299
因为他不想让谢尔顿尴尬
...because he didn't want sheldon to be embarrassed.

274
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,339
其实这根本没什么可尴尬的  知道吗
And there is nothing to be embarrassed about, okay?

275
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,799
在美国谁家都会有个亲戚
Every family in america has a relative

276
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:02,999
干点不大光彩的事情
Holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.

277
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:04,609
不  我也糊涂了
No, I'm lost, too.

278
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:06,599
我觉得她跳过了一步
I think she skipped a step.

279
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,969
不是  你们听我说
No, look.

280
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,219
谢尔顿的表弟里奥逃离了戒毒所
Sheldon's cousin leo escaped rehab,

281
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:11,809
他现在躲在长滩的一家汽车旅馆
And he's in a motel 8 in long beach.

282
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:14,069
他们全家出动参加调停会
The whole family's going out for an intervention.

283
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:15,799
莱纳德要开车送谢尔顿去
Leonard is driving sheldon down there

284
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,639
帮他表弟渡过难关  因为他真的是个好人哦
To help him through this, because he's such a good man.

285
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:21,099
又抱我一次?  谢谢
Oh, another hug? thank you.

286
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,869
好了  朋友们  祝你们好运
All right, you guys, good luck.

287
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:24,969
谢谢  潘妮  
Thanks, penny.

288
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,169
祝你演出成功
Oh-- break a leg.

289
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,269
演出成功
Break a leg.

290
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:29,969
开车去长滩
So, road trip to long beach.

291
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,739
不  我们不去长滩
No. we're not going to long beach.

292
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:32,419
为什么
Why not?

293
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,969
因为谢尔顿根本就没有一个
Because sheldon doesn't have

294
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,599
吸毒的叫里奥珀德的表弟
A drug-addicted cousin leopold.

295
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:37,639
太遗憾了
Oh, too bad.

296
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:40,089
我一直都想去长滩
I've always wanted to go to long beach.

297
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:41,799
的确是个不错的地方
It's a very nice community.

298
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,439
玛丽女王号就停靠在那里
The queen mary is docked there.

299
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:45,519
它曾是世上最大的远洋客轮
Once the largest ocean liner in the world,

300
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,819
现在成了一家酒店和餐厅
It's now a hotel and restaurant,

301
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:48,639
为顾客提供极其扣人心弦的
Where they host a surprisingly gripping

302
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:50,539
离奇谋杀主题晚宴
Murder mystery dinner.

303
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:51,799
听起来挺有趣  我要去
Sounds fun. I'm game.

304
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:52,799
出发!
Shotgun!

305
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:54,869
别  别  别
No, no, no.

306
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:57,339
莱纳德要坐前排  否则他会恶心呕吐
Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front,

307
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,769
不过即便这样  也很难保证
And even then, it's iffy.

308
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:03,539
等等  我们...真要去长滩啊?!
Wait, are we... really going to long beach?!

309
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:11,799
莱纳德
Leonard?

310
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:13,639
莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard? leonard?

311
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,239
别再想了  谢尔顿
Let it go, sheldon.

312
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,489
不管你觉得说不说得通
The murderer was the first mate

313
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:19,039
谋杀犯就是第一个同事
Whether it makes sense to you or not.

314
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:21,899
不是  我才不关心那个呢
No, that's the least of our worries.

315
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,199
我一直在做一些关于吸毒方面的研究...
I've been doing some research on addiction--

316
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,439
既有生物化学方面的也有行为方面的...
Both the biochemical and behavioral aspects--

317
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:27,509
我觉得我们现在这个
And I think there's a problem

318
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,549
版本的谎话有个问题
With the current version of our lie.

319
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:30,719
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

320
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:33,369
无所谓了  她相信了  都结束了
It's fine-- she bought it; it's over.

321
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,879
可惜的是  并没有
Sadly, it's not.

322
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,919
对抗毒品不是一朝一夕的事
Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle,

323
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,969
抛开这点  我意识到我所描述的这个里奥
But beyond that, I have realized that the leo I described

324
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,559
根本就不会同意到戒毒所接受治疗
Would not have agreed to go to rehab.

325
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,369
为什么
Why not?

326
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,339
因为里奥是中间儿
Because leo's a middle child.

327
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,339
中间儿综合症是指排行老二或者排在中间的孩子，
由于没有老大或最小的孩子那么“受关注”，因此产生的一些心理问题

328
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,139
根本就没里奥这个人!
There is no leo!

329
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,199
你怎么就能说这些?
How can you say that?

330
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,619
你没读过他的简历  是吗
You didn't read the bio, did you?

331
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:00,719
他不仅是个中间儿
He's not just a middle child,

332
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:02,359
他更是个典型的中间儿...
He is the quintessential middle child--

333
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,899
附:他出自破碎家庭
From a broken home, to boot.

334
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,369
从心理学上讲  即使会导致自我毁灭
Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling,

335
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:09,299
对他来说  通过反抗所获得的关注度
Even to the point of self-destruction,

336
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:11,869
在情感上的价值要远远超过康复治疗所带来的效果
Is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.

337
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:13,339
我倒有个主意
I've got a solution.

338
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,239
太好了  什么
Great. what is it?

339
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,769
出  去!
Get out!

340
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,669
好吧
Fine.

341
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:26,259
我一直犹豫要不要说
I've hesitated to point this out,

342
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:28,039
但我必须提醒你的是
But I must now remind you that we

343
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,969
我们目前的窘境完全是因为你先前
Are in our current predicament because of your initial

344
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:31,479
理由相当不充分的欺骗行为造成的
And totally inadequate deceit.

345
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,799
我只是想替你收拾残局而已
I'm just trying to clean up after your mess.

346
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,519
我们明早再说
We'll talk in the morning.

347
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:53,719
早
Morning.

348
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:56,179
你是谁
Who are you?

349
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,029
我是谢尔顿的表弟里奥
I am sheldon's cousin leo.

350
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,039
谢尔顿根本没有一个叫里奥的表弟
Sheldon does not have a cousin leo.

351
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:07,889
恰恰相反
Au contraire.

352
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,449
我今年26岁
I'm 26 years old.

353
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:13,139
我的祖籍是...德克萨斯州的登顿市
I'm originally from... denton, texas,

354
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,139
但我是个海军顽童  所以我从小
But I was a navy brat, so I was

355
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,499
是在世界各地的军事基地长大的
Brought up on a variety of military bases around the world.

356
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:20,189
因此  我总感觉跟群体格格不入...
As a result, I've often felt like an outsider--

357
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:21,569
从没真正融入过
Never really fitting in,

358
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,939
这也很可能是我滥用毒品的原因
Which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.

359
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:27,369
打扰一下  我们刚才还练习过一遍
Excuse me, we just went over this.

360
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:29,909
作为一个典型的中间儿  你的赌瘾
As the quintessential middle child, your addiction

361
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:32,239
根植于你未被满足的对关注度的需求当中
Is rooted in your unmet need for attention.

362
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:35,339
谢尔顿  我们不是真的要用通俗心理学吧?
Oh, sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology?

363
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,939
请注意  这些都是以有力的研究为根据的
For your information, this is all based on solid research.

364
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:40,639
完全依照我写给你的性格档案就行了
Just stick with the character profile I wrote for you.

365
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:41,939
-谢尔顿?  -不好意思
Sheldon? I'm sorry.

366
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:44,379
莱纳德  这位是托比・鲁本菲尔德
Leonard, this is toby loobenfeld.

367
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,709
他是粒子物理实验室的
He's a research assistant

368
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,139
一名研究助理
In the particle physics lab,

369
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,529
不过他同时在麻省理工辅修戏剧
But he also minored in theater at mit.

370
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,699
事实上  说双学位更准确些
It was more of a double major, actually.

371
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:54,009
戏剧和物理
Theater and physics.

372
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:55,999
可以猜一下哪门是我中产阶级的父母
You can guess which one my bourgeois parents

373
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:56,839
逼我学的
Pushed me toward.

374
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:58,199
行了  我知道了
Yeah, I got it.

375
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:00,299
谢尔顿...你这是为什么
Sheldon... why?

376
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:03,199
你想啊  鉴于里奥不会去接受康复治疗
You see, while leo would not have gone into rehab,

377
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:06,099
那我们把他从汽车旅馆劝回家
It is completely plauible that we would have talked him

378
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:08,939
就是完全可以解释通的了
Into leaving the motel and coming home with us.

379
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:11,099
谢尔顿  这样设计
Oh... sheldon, how about this

380
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:13,269
我的动机如何...我14岁那年
As my motivation-- when I was 14 years old,

381
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,839
在菲律宾被一个先天脚畸形的海军教士虐待
I was abused in the philippines by a clubfooted navy chaplain.

382
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:21,169
不行  就设计成一个中间儿
No. we're going with middle child

383
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:25,059
具有血液中复合胺含量不足的遗传体质倾向
And a genetic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.

384
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:28,559
亏你想得出来  遗传体质你要我怎么扮?
Swell. how do I play genetic predisposition?

385
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:31,839
当然是如字面意思所示
Subtextually, of course.

386
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:36,329
尽情享受就好了
Just have fun with it.

387
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,339
早  潘妮
Morning, penny.

388
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,999
家庭会议开得怎么样?
Hi. how did the intervention go?

389
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,439
很不幸  我们没能说服他去戒毒所接受治疗
Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.

390
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,229
基于你昨天跟我说的那些  我一点都不惊讶
Oh. well, based on what you told me, I am not surprised.

391
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,169
但我们说服他搬出汽车旅馆了
But we did convince him to leave the motel.

392
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,739
进来认识一下
Come say hello.

393
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:01,569
里奥  这位是潘妮
Leo. this is penny,

394
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,739
我们的朋友和邻居
Our friend and neighbor.

395
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,299
你好  里奥
Hi, leo.

396
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,199
你现在感觉如何
How are you feeling?

397
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,199
潘妮  问你个问题
Let me ask you something, penny.

398
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:15,969
你有过吐得浑身都是  然后一觉醒来
Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel

399
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,669
发现自己身在一个破烂的汽车旅馆
Covered in your own vomit,

400
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:20,699
身边还躺着个人妖妓女的经历吗
Next to a transsexual prostitute?

401
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,699
没有
No.

402
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:28,039
那就别问我感觉如何
Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.

403
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:31,469
这位就是里奥
Well, that's leo.

404
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:35,539
跟我说说你昨晚的演出吧
Why don't you tell me about your showcase last night.

405
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,969
还好啦  我觉得
Oh. it was okay, I guess.

406
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,009
场面不算太热烈
It wasn't a big turnout,

407
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:39,969
但他俩好像都很喜欢我的表演
But they both really seemed to like it.

408
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,699
就俩人?
There were only two people there?

409
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,299
坚持到最后的  是的
By the end, yeah.

410
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:47,739
你个该死的哈里根教士!
Damn you, chaplain harrigan!

411
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:51,069
你...你说什么
I'm... I'm sorry?

412
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:52,939
那是在菲律宾的时候
