1
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:11,708
既然没人愿意承认 那就让我来吧
Okay, if no one else will say it, I will.

2
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:15,058
我们的彩蛋射击技术逊毙了
We really suck at paintball.

3
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:17,058
简直丢脸丢到家
That was absolutely humiliating.

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,208
哦 拜托 胜败乃兵家常事啊
Oh, come on. Some battles you win, some battles you lose.

5
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:25,968
可也不能输给凯尔那帮犹太小男生啊
Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah party.

6
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:27,458
我想我们得承认
I think we have to acknowledge,

7
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:31,878
对方手段太野蛮了
those were some fairly savage preadolescent Jews.

8
00:00:33,498 --> 00:00:36,088
不 我们的惨败是源于我们自己的无能
No,we were annihilated by our own incompetence

9
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:39,158
以及某些人没有能够听从指挥
and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.

10
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:40,808
谢尔顿 别再计较了!
Sheldon,let it go!

11
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:45,428
不行 我想说说沃罗威茨从背后袭击我的事
No,I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.

12
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:46,978
我有充分的理由
I shot you for good reason.

13
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:50,238
你正把我们引向灾难之中
You were leading us into disaster.

14
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,698
我的命令清晰而且明确
I was giving clear,concise orders.

15
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:55,068
你躲在树后面喊 "打那个戴帽子的小孩!
You hid behind a tree yelling,"Get the kid in the yarmulke!

16
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:57,258
"打那个戴帽子的小孩!"
Get the kid in the yarmulke!"

17
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,468
嗨 你们好
Oh,hey,guys.

18
00:00:58,468 --> 00:01:01,408
- 嗨 佩妮 - 早上好 女士
-Oh,hey,Penny. Hello. -Morning,ma'am.

19
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:03,778
游戏如何 好玩吗?
So,how was paintball?Did you have fun?

20
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:08,138
当然 如果你觉得被自己人暗算也开心的话
Sure,if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.

21
00:01:08,388 --> 00:01:12,338
你最好把日程空出来 我会就此事提出质询的
You clear space on your calendar--there will be an inquiry.

22
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,658
好吧
Okay.

23
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:14,928
对了 周六我会开个派对
Um,hey,I'm having a party on Saturday,

24
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:16,548
你们有空的话 不如一起过来玩吧
so if you guys are around,you should come on by.

25
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:17,758
- 派对? - 是啊
-A party? -Yeah.

26
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:21,388
是... ‘男女’ 派对?
A... "boy-girl" party?

27
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:26,198
呃...肯定有男生 也肯定有女生 而且也是场派对
Well,there will be boys and there will be girls and it is a party,so...

28
00:01:26,198 --> 00:01:27,328
其实也就是邀请一帮朋友
It'll just be a bunch of my friends.

29
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:29,298
喝喝啤酒 跳跳舞
We'll have some beer,do a little dancing.

30
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,188
跳舞?
Dancing?

31
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:31,598
嗯 我不能确定 佩妮...
Yeah,I don't know,Penny...

32
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:32,568
其实 我们不太...
The thing is,we're not...

33
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:35,948
- 我们更适合...  - 不行
-No,we're really more of a... -No.

34
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:38,118
不过谢谢你能邀请我们
But thanks.Thanks for thinking of us.

35
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:40,238
确信吗? 来嘛 万圣节哦
Are you sure? Come on,it's Halloween.

36
00:01:40,238 --> 00:01:41,598
万圣节派对?
A Halloween party?

37
00:01:41,598 --> 00:01:43,188
化妆舞会吗?
As in... costumes?

38
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:46,148
当然了
Well,yeah.

39
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:54,948
有主题吗?
Is there a theme?

40
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,408
呃 万圣节咯
Um,yeah,Halloween.

41
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,928
是的 不过服装是随自己意呢 还是有风格限制的?
Yes,but are the costumes random,or genre-specific?

42
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:03,398
和以前一样 我还是没听懂
As usual,I'm not following.

43
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:07,698
他是想问 我们能不能打扮成科幻片里面的人物 ...
He's asking if we can come as anyone from science fiction,fantasy...

44
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:09,088
- 当然  - 漫画里的人呢?
-Sure.  -What about comic books?

45
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:10,118
- 当然   - 动漫?
-Fine.  -Anime?

46
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:11,448

48
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,898

Anything you want! Okay?

49
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:19,018
怎么样打扮都行
Any costume you want.

50
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:21,348
再见
Bye.

51
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:25,028
各位 向缝纫机前进!
Gentlemen,to the sewing machines.

52
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:47,827
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第06集
The.Middle.Earth.Paradigm

53
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:54,036
我来开
I'll get it.

54
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:11,096
哦 不
Oh,no.

55
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,736
哦 不
Oh,no.

56
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:17,396
给世界上速度最快的人让路了!
Make way for the fastest man alive!

57
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:18,766
哦 不
Oh,no.

58
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:21,646
看吧 我都说了应该先开会讨论一下嘛
See,this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.

59
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:24,606
我们还有别的服装 换一下就可以了
We all have other costumes: We can change.

60
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:27,196
或者我们可以整晚都保持一列纵队
Or we could walk right behind each other all night

61
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:30,816
看起来就像是一个人在快速移动
and look like one person going really fast.

62
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:38,726
不不不
No,no,no.

63
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:43,146
这是男女派对 闪电侠得单独行动
It's a boy-girl party,this flash runs solo.

64
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,516
不如这样
Okay,how about this?

65
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,776
谁都不许穿成闪电侠
Nobody gets to be The Flash.

66
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:48,496
全部去换掉 如何?
We all change. Agreed?

67
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,896
同意
Agreed.

68
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:53,226
我要扮弗拉多!  (电影<魔戒>中人物)
I call Frodo!

69
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:55,606
该死!
Damn!

70
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:02,676
嘿
Hey.

71
00:04:04,826 --> 00:04:09,096
抱歉迟到 我的锤子被公交车门卡住了
Sorry I'm late,but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.

72
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:10,436
你要扮雷神托尔?
You went with Thor?

73
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:14,246
怎么 印度人就不能扮北欧神祗了吗?
What,just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse god?

74
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:17,406
"不不 拉杰只能演印度神仙"
"No,no,Raj has to be an Indian god."

75
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:18,876
这是种族歧视
That's racism.

76
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:20,916
我说 看看沃罗威茨 他也不是英国人
I mean look at Wolowitz.He's not English,

77
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,776
可是他打扮成了彼得・潘
but he's dressed like Peter Pan.

78
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:25,876
谢尔顿既不是声波也不是光波
Sheldon is neither sound nor light,

79
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:28,796
但很明显 他穿成了多普勒效应
but he's obviously the Doppler effect.

80
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:33,736
我不是彼得潘
I'm not Peter Pan.

81
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:35,516
我是罗宾汉
I'm Robin Hood.

82
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:36,436
是啊?
Really?

83
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:40,756
我看过彼得潘 你穿的和凯西・瑞比一模一样
Because I sawPeter Pan,and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby.

84
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:40,756
著名百老汇演员 在舞台上饰演该角色24年之久

85
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:45,216
她比你大了一号 不过造型完全一样 伙计
She was a little bigger than you,but it's basically the same look,man.

86
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:46,786
谢尔顿 
Hey,Sheldon

87
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,926
派对开始前我得先和你谈谈
There's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.

88
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:50,556
我不管别人看不看得懂
I don't care if anybody gets it.

89
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:53,236
我就是要穿成多普勒效应
I'm going as the Doppler effect.

90
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:57,176
- 我不是要说这个  - 如果有必要 我会当场演示
-No,it's not that. -If I have to,I can demonstrate.

91
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:03,096
好极了
Terrific.

92
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:07,136
这次派对是佩妮第一次 
this party is my first chance for Penny

93
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:09,866
邀请我加入她的社交圈
to see me in the context of her social group,

94
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:13,146
我希望你今晚不能给我难堪
and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.

95
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:16,746
你说让你难堪是什么意思?
Well,what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?

96
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:18,836
比方说 今天晚上
Well,for example,tonight,

97
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:22,186
没人需要知道我的中间名是里克
no one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.

98
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:24,246
这和难堪根本一点关系也没有
But there's nothing embarrassing about that.

99
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:27,636
你父亲曾经和伟大的人类学家路易斯・里克一起工作过
Your father worked with Louis Leakey, a great anthropologist.

100
00:05:27,636 --> 00:05:30,386
跟你尿床的事一点关系也没有
It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.

101
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:35,606
总之我的意思是 这次派对是大好机会
All m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny

102
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:38,046
佩妮可以把我当成她的同伴看待
to see me as a member of her peer group,

103
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:42,656
一个潜在的亲密好友 或许还能更进一步
a potential close friend,and perhaps more,

104
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:45,736
我不想看起来像一个怪胎
and I don't want to look like a dork.

105
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:56,586
先告诉你们 各位
Just a heads up,fellas.

106
00:05:56,586 --> 00:06:00,506
如果有谁交了好运 我的箭筒里有一打套套
If anyone gets lucky,I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver.

107
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:03,756
嗨 各位
Oh,hey,guys.

108
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:05,436
嘿 对不起来晚了
Hey. Sorry we're late.

109
00:06:05,436 --> 00:06:06,336
晚?
Late?

110
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:07,546
才7:05呢
It's 7:05.

111
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:09,736
你说过派对7点开始
And you said the party starts at 7:00.

112
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,866
没错 可是如果派对定在7点
Well,yeah,I mean,when you start a party at 7:00,

113
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:15,576
没人会7点就入场
no one shows up at,you know,7:00.

114
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:18,686
已经7:05了
It's 7:05.

115
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:20,396
是是 没错
Yes. Yes,it is.

116
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:23,246
好吧 请进
Okay. Well,um,come on in.

117
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:33,636
怎么 女生全部去了洗手间吗?
So,what,are all the girls in the bathroom?

118
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:36,986
很有可能 她们自己家里的洗手间
Probably,but in their own homes.

119
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:40,466
那个...服装展示什么时候开始?
So,what time does the costume parade start?

120
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:42,296
展示?
The parade?

121
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:45,436
对啊 这样评委可以给最佳造型颁奖
Yeah,so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume.

122
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:47,326
比如最吓人奖 最逼真奖
You know,most frightening,most authentic,

123
00:06:47,326 --> 00:06:51,186
科学原理演示之最佳视觉效果奖
most accurate visualization of a scientific principal.

124
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:54,386
真抱歉 谢尔顿
Oh,Sheldon,I'm sorry,

125
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:55,766
可是不会有什么展示
but there aren't going to be any parades

126
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:59,206
评委或在奖品什么的
or judges or prizes.

127
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:02,246
这派对一定会很糟糕的
This party is just going to suck.

128
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:04,376
不！拜托 一定会好玩的
No! Come on,it's going to be fun,

129
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:05,426
你们看起来都棒极了
and you all look great.

130
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,036
看 你是雷神托尔
I mean,look at you,Thor,

131
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:10,696
还有~ 彼得・潘 这太可爱了
and,oh,Peter Pan. That's so cute.

132
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,856
- 其实上 佩妮 他是罗宾汉  - 我是彼得・潘
-Actually,Penny,he's Robin Hood. -I'm Peter Pan.

133
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:18,816
我手里还有一把有你名字的魔法粉
And I got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.

134
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,896
你才没有
No,you don't.

135
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:24,916
呃 谢尔顿穿的是什么?
Uh,hey,what's Sheldon supposed to be?

136
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,256
哦 他那是多普勒效应
Oh,he's the Doppler effect.

137
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:30,106
当声源和观察者之间的距离发生变化时
Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave

138
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:34,686
波动的频率也会发生明显变化
caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.

139
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:37,586
哦 我知道了
Oh,sure,I see it now.

140
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:39,696
多普勒效应嘛
The Doppler effect.

141
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:40,676
好的 我得去洗澡了
All right,I got to shower.

142
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:43,816
你们 自己好好玩吧
You guys,um,make yourselves comfortable.

143
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:45,516
好的
Okay.

144
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:49,696
瞧见没? 人们能明白的
See? People get it.

145
00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:06,236
以奥丁的胡子起誓 实在太好吃了
By Odin's beard,this is good Chex mix.

146
00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:06,236
奥丁 北欧神话中的主神

147
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,796
不用了 谢谢 有花生
No,thanks. Peanuts.

148
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:10,916
穿这么紧 我可不能肿起来
I can't afford to swell up in these tights.

149
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,306
我搞不懂
I'm confused.

150
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:15,906
如果没有服装展示 我们在这干吗?
If there's no costume parade,what are we doing here?

151
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:19,226
参与社交活动啊 认识新朋友
We're socializing,meeting new people.

152
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:21,826
靠传心术吗?
Telepathically?

153
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:24,516
嗨 你们什么时候来的?
Oh,hey,when did you get here?

154
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:25,496
嗨
Hi.

155
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:28,386
佩妮的那件猫女装是我见过最丑的
Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I've ever seen.

156
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:30,746
比哈里・贝瑞还差 
And that includes Halle Berry's.

157
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:30,746
哈里・贝瑞 她曾因<猫女>一片勇夺金酸梅最差女主角

158
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:33,676
她不是猫女 只是一只普通的猫
She's not Catwoman. She's just a generic cat.

159
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:35,616
正是由于竞争机制的缺乏
And that's the kind of sloppy costuming

160
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:39,496
才会导致这种三流造型的出现
which results from a lack of rules and competion.

161
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:43,696
嘿 快瞧那个性感小护士
Hey,guys,check out the sexy nurse.

162
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:49,076
我相信是时候采取行动了
I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.

163
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:50,996
你准备怎么做?
What is your move?

164
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:53,216
采取镜子战术
I'm going to use the mirror technique.

165
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,216
她拨她的头发 我就拨我的
She brushes her hair back,I brush my hair back...

166
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:56,236
她耸肩 我也耸肩
She shrugs,I shrug.

167
00:08:56,236 --> 00:09:00,016
她下意识里就会觉得 我们心有灵犀 注定是一对
Subconsciously she's thinking,"We're in sync. We belong together."

168
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:02,436
你哪学来的这一套?
Where do you get this stuff?

169
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:05,376
心理学期刊 国际性研究
You know,psychology journals,Internet research,

170
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:10,106
而且在VH-1台上也有教如何追求女孩的好节目
and there's this great show on VH-1 about how to pick up girls.

171
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:14,006
我有他那么自信就好了
Oh,if only I had his confidence.

172
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:18,026
我跟女人说话都困难 呆在女生旁边也是...
I have such difficulty speaking to women,or around women...

173
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:22,176
甚至包括娘娘腔的男人
or at times even effeminate men.

174
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:23,826
如果那个听诊器能正常使用
If that's a working stethoscope,

175
00:09:23,826 --> 00:09:27,626
或许你想听听我击鼓般的心跳声?
maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat?

176
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:28,916
不用了
No,thanks.

177
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,956
我说真的 我有瞬间自发性心律失常
No,seriously,you can.I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.

178
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:40,836
我想去认识佩妮的朋友们
I want to get to know Penny's friends,

179
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:44,716
我只是… 但我不知道该怎么和这些人说话
I just… I don't know how to talk to these people.

180
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:47,986
这点上 我可能会帮上忙
Well,I actually might be able to help.

181
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:49,066
怎么说?
How so?

182
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:51,556
就像珍・古德观察黑猩猩一样 
Like Jane Goodall observing the apes,

183
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:51,556
英国科学家 以对黑猩猩的研究闻名世界

184
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:55,226
我发现一开始他们之间的互动是混乱且无组织性的
I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured.

185
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:56,686
但渐渐有模式可循
But patterns emerge.

186
00:09:56,686 --> 00:10:00,606
他们有自己独特的语言
They have their own language,if you will.

187
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:02,516
继续
Go on.

188
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:06,866
新来的人在接近现有的一伙聊天的人时 会说
Well,it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting,

189
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,766
"我看起来喝醉了吗?"
"How wasted am I?"

190
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:12,746
然后就会有一阵类似“伙计”之类的欢迎声
Which is met with an approving chorus of "Dude."

191
00:10:13,286 --> 00:10:14,686
然后呢?
Then what happens?

192
00:10:14,686 --> 00:10:17,366
我只观察到这些
That's as far as I've gotten.

193
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:19,186
真是荒谬
This is ridiculous.

194
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,486
我准备上了
I'm jumping in.

195
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,376
祝你好运
Good luck.

196
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:22,816
不 你跟我一起
No,you're coming with me.

197
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:25,206
我可不这么想
Oh,I hardly think so.

198
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:26,746
拜托
Oh,come on.

199
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:28,496
你不怕我给你难堪?
Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?

200
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:31,116
怕 可我需要一个副手
Yes; but I need a wing man.

201
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:31,116
wingman:原意指护航的飞机

202
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:34,056
好吧 可是如果要拿飞行来做比喻的话
All right,but if we're going to use flight metaphors,

203
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:39,246
我更适合联邦航空局事故调查员的角色
I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA analyzing wreckage.

204
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:42,406
嗨
Hi.

205
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:44,026
- 嗨 - 你好
Hi. Hello.

206
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:46,016
你这身是扮的是什么?
So what are you supposed to be?

207
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:49,566
我? 我给点提示
Me? I'll give you a hint.

208
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:54,356
玩具火车?
A choo-choo train?

209
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:56,096
接近了!
Close!

210
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:01,616
一列脑震荡的火车?
A brain damaged choo-choo train?

211
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:06,906
我看起来喝醉了吗?
How wasted am I?

212
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:17,947
我还是不懂
I still don't get it.

213
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:19,907
我是多普勒效应
I'm the Doppler effect.

214
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:22,077
如果这是指一种"学习障碍"
Okay,if that's some sort of learning disability,

215
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:24,977
那么你也模仿得太烂了
I think it's very insensitive.

216
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:29,297
为什么不跟别人说你是只斑马呢?
Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?

217
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:32,507
那你怎么不告诉人家你是 七个小矮人之一?
Well,why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?

218
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:33,727
因为我是弗拉多
Because I'm Frodo.

219
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:37,087
没错 很好 因为我是多普勒效应
Yes,well,I'm the Doppler effect.

220
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:40,107
- 不会吧 - 怎么了?
-Oh,no.  -What?

221
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:42,077
那是佩妮的前男友
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

222
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,027
他来这里干吗?
What do you suppose he's doing here?

223
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:47,677
干扰这里的重力场吗?
Besides disrupting the local gravity field.

224
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:51,077
他要是再大块点 月亮都会绕着他转
If he were any bigger,he'd have moons orbiting him.

225
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,807
你真刻薄
Oh,snap.

226
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:56,337
那么 我们似乎该走了
So,I guess we'll be leaving now.

227
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:58,237
为什么要我们走?
Why should we leave?

228
00:11:58,237 --> 00:12:03,087
很明显他是不请自来 佩妮看都不想看他
For all we know he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here.

229
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:06,157
还有后备的假设吗?
You have a backup hypothesis?

230
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:08,627
也许他们只是想做回朋友
Maybe they want to be friends.

231
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:12,507
又或者她想做朋友 而他想要更多
Or maybe she wants to be friends and he wants something more.

232
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:14,717
那么他和我就在同一高度
Then he and I are on equal ground.

233
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:18,097
没错 但你比他更接近地面
Yes,but you're much closer to it than he is.

234
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,787
如果是1500年前
Look,if this was 1,500 years ago,

235
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:23,707
凭他的体格和力量
by virtue of his size and strength,

236
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:26,257
科特想挑选哪个女人都可以
Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.

237
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:29,507
还有男人 动物 巨型远古茄子
And male partners,animal partners, large primordial eggplants--

238
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:32,257
几乎所有他想要的东西
pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.

239
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:35,497
没错 但现在的社会已经发生了根本的转换
Yes,but our society has undergone a paradigm shift.

240
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:37,437
在信息时代 谢尔顿
In the Information Age,Sheldon,

241
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:39,917
你和我才是最优秀的
you and I are the alpha males.

242
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:41,727
我们不该退缩
We shouldn't have to back down.

243
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:42,617
是的
True.

244
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:45,887
你干吗不发短信给他看他会不会退缩?
Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?

245
00:12:46,477 --> 00:12:48,167
不
No.

246
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:52,357
我要面对面向他展现我的优势
I'm going to assert my dominance face-to-face.

247
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:54,777
面对面? 你是要他坐下
Face-to-face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down,

248
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:57,567
还是自己站在咖啡桌上?
or are you going to stand on the coffee table?

249
00:12:58,757 --> 00:12:59,867
嗨 佩妮
Hello,Penny.

250
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:00,767
嗨 科特
Hello,Kurt.

251
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,847
嗨 你们玩得还好吗?
Oh,hey,guys,are you having a good time?

252
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,097
鉴于人们对我扮相的反应
Given the reaction to my costume,

253
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:08,677
这次派对是对美国教育制度的严厉控诉
this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.

254
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:11,487
你是斑马 对吧?
What,you're a zebra,right?

255
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:14,367
有一个低能儿童
Yet another child left behind.

256
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:16,857
你又是什么 精灵?
And what are you supposed to be,an elf?

257
00:13:16,857 --> 00:13:18,307
不 我是霍比特人
No,I'm a hobbit.

258
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:19,977
有什么不同?
What's the difference?

259
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:22,867
霍比特人是居住在中土世界 生命有限的矮人
A hobbit is a mortal halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth,

260
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:26,437
而精灵则是永生而高大的战士
whereas an elf is an immortal,tall warrior.

261
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:29,547
那你为什么要做个矮人呢?
So why the hell would you want to be a hobbit?

262
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:31,547
因为他既不高也会死
Because he's neither tall nor immortal

263
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:34,177
而且我们没有人可以做闪电侠
and none of us could be The Flash.

264
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:35,797
随你怎说
Well,whatever.

265
00:13:35,797 --> 00:13:37,757
不如你们赶紧消失
Why don't you go hop off on a quest?

266
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:39,237
我正和佩妮说话呢
I'm talking to Penny here.

267
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:41,177
我想我们都在和佩妮说话
I think we're all talking to Penny here.

268
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:43,767
我没有 我没恶意
I'm not. No offense.

269
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,417
好吧 可能你没听懂我意思
Okay,maybe you didn't hear me.

270
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,657
- 滚蛋 - 好啦 科特 有礼貌点
-Go away.  -All right,Kurt,be nice.

271
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:50,407
我很有礼貌
Oh,I am being nice.

272
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:52,157
对不对 小朋友?
Right,little buddy?

273
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:54,377
- 科特 - 好吧
-Kurt.  -Okay.

274
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:58,697
我明白你企图用武力来恐吓我
I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me.

275
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:01,227
因为你在智力上无法和我匹敌
I mean,you can't compete with me on an intellectual level

276
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:04,197
所以你只能选择这种动物似的方式
so you're driven to animalistic puffery.

277
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:06,697
你是说 我是动物吗?
You calling me a puffy animal?

278
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:08,657
当然不是啦 不 他不是
Of course not. No,he's not.

279
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:10,957
你不是 对吧 莱纳德?
You're not,right,Leonard?

280
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:13,647
不 我是说"动物似的"
No,I said "animalistic."

281
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:15,247
当然我们都是动物
Of course we're all animals,

282
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:18,797
只不过我们当中一些人 在进化树上爬得更高一些
but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.

283
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:21,077
要是他听懂了 你就完蛋了
If he understands that,you're in trouble.

284
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:23,147
所以怎样 你说我没进化吗?
So,what,I'm unevolved?

285
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:25,307
你完蛋了
You're in trouble.

286
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:28,687
作为一个侏儒 你用的词还真够大的
You know,you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.

287
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:30,367
好吧 科特 别这样
Okay,Kurt,please.

288
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:33,487
佩妮 没关系 我可以处理
Penny,it's okay. I can handle this.

289
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:35,197
我不是侏儒
I am not a dwarf,

290
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:36,867
我是霍比特人
I'm a hobbit.

291
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:38,137
一个霍比特人...
A hobbit.

292
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:41,017
你大脑海马区里坏掉的神经元
Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion

293
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:44,557
阻碍了短期记忆到长期记忆的转换吗
from short-term to long-term memory?

294
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:49,197
好吧 现在你惹火我了
Okay,now you're starting to make me mad.

295
00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:53,427
一个发现自己可对立拇指的人猿说什么?
A homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?

296
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,687
什么?
What?

297
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:01,317
我想我已经说得很清楚了
I think I've made my point.

298
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,727
是吗? 不如我在你的小脑袋上 凿个洞让你更清楚点?
Yeah? How about I make a point out of your pointy little head?

299
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:07,447
我要提醒你 尽管精神上我绝对支持你
Let me remind you,while my moral support is absolute,

300
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:10,617
但在肢体冲突上 我的作用是零
in a physical confrontation,I will be less than useless.

301
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,797
根本就不会有什么冲突的 
There's not going to be a confrontation.

302
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:17,097
说实话 我怀疑他能不能拼 "冲突"这个单词 
In fact,I doubt if he can even spell "confrontation."

303
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:21,817
C-O-N...
C-O-N...

304
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:24,127
frontation! 
frontation!

305
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:26,087
科特 马上放他下来
Kurt,put him down this instant!

306
00:15:26,087 --> 00:15:27,097
他先惹我的
He started it!

307
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:30,297
我不管 我想结束这事 总之放下他
I don't care. I'm finishing it.Put him down!

308
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,227
好吧
Fine.

309
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:36,257
算你个妖精走运
You're one lucky little leprechaun.

310
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,267
他是霍比特人!
He's a hobbit!

311
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:41,597
我顶你
I got your back.

312
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:43,087
莱纳德 你没事吧?
Leonard,are you okay?

313
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,437
我很好
Yeah,I'm fine.

314
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:49,817
这派对很棒 谢谢你邀请我们
It's good,it's a good party,thanks for having us.

315
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:51,947
时间也不早了 所以...
It's just getting a little late,so...

316
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:53,547
好吧
Oh,okay.

317
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:56,257
好吧 谢谢你们能来
All right,well,thank you for coming.

318
00:15:58,477 --> 00:16:01,487
万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween.

319
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:04,677
如果这也算安慰的话
If it's any consolation,

320
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:08,977
我想说 你那句"人猿"的确很适合他
I thought that homo habilis line really put him in his place.

321
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:18,697
那是什么?
What's that?

322
00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:20,467
茶
Tea.

323
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:21,937
当人们沮丧的时候
When people are upset,

324
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:25,947
传统上应该给他们一点热饮
the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages.

325
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:34,477
好啦 好啦
There,there.

326
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:37,627
要谈谈吗?
You want to talk about it?

327
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:39,847
- 不 - 太好了
-No.  -Good.

328
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,727
我能说的也只有"好啦 好啦"了
"There,there" was really all I had.

329
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,237
晚安 谢尔顿
Good night,Sheldon.

330
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,287
晚安 莱纳德
Good night,Leonard.

331
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,697
嘿 莱纳德?
Hey,Leonard?

332
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:55,977
嗨 佩妮
Hi,Penny.

333
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:57,937
我只是来看看你有没事
Hey,I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

334
00:16:57,937 --> 00:17:00,507
我很好
I'm fine.

335
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:03,897
刚才的事真不好意思
I am so sorry about what happened.

336
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,627
那不是你的错
It's not your fault.

337
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:06,807
不 怪我
Yes,it is.

338
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:08,237
这就是我和他分手的原因
That's why I broke up with him.

339
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:11,487
他总是这样
He always does stuff like that.

340
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:14,777
那他怎么会出现在派对上?
So why was he at your party?

341
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:22,507
上周我碰见他 他道歉说他已经变了
Well,I ran into him last week and he was just all apologetic about how he's changed.

342
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:24,867
他不停的说啊说…
And he was just going on and on and...

343
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,537
我就相信了 我真是个笨蛋 
I believed him and I'm an idiot

344
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:29,577
因为我总是那么容易相信那种男人
because I always believe guys like that.

345
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:31,907
我根本不想回去 因为他还待在那
And I can't go back to my party because he's there.

346
00:17:31,907 --> 00:17:33,637
我知道你不想听这些 但我很伤心
And know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset

347
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:37,327
还喝醉了 我只想...
and I'm really drunk and I just want to...

348
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:48,137
好啦 好啦
There,there.

349
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:52,557
天啊 我做错什么了吗?
God,what is wrong with me?

350
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:54,187
没有 你很完美
Nothing,you're perfect.

351
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:55,737
我不完美
I'm not perfect.

352
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:58,127
不 你是
Yes,you are.

353
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:03,477
你真的这么想?
You really think so,don't you?

354
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:17,387
佩妮?
Penny?

355
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,437
恩?
Yeah?

356
00:18:19,437 --> 00:18:22,937
你今晚喝了多少?
How much have you had to drink tonight?

357
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:27,907
就...很多
Just... a lot.

358
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:32,397
你确信你不是因为喝醉酒而且对科特的事生气
Are you sure that your being drunk and your being angry with Kurt

359
00:18:32,397 --> 00:18:36,367
现在才这样做吗
doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?

360
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:39,787
可能有吧
It might.

361
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:42,867
你太聪明了
Boy,you're really smart.

362
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:46,547
是啊 我TMD就是个天才
Yeah,I'm a frickin' genius.

363
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:52,177
莱纳德 你真是太好了
Leonard,you are so great.

364
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:55,117
为什么男人都不能像你这样？
Why can't all guys be like you?

365
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:56,697
如果是那样的话
Because if all guys were like me,

366
00:18:56,697 --> 00:19:00,327
人类就无法繁衍了
the human race couldn't survive.

367
00:19:03,437 --> 00:19:05,217
我想我该走了
I should probably go.

368
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:07,847
是的
Probably.

369
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:18,147
谢谢
Thank you.

370
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:30,887
是的 你没看错
That's right,you saw what you saw.

371
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:35,577
我们在夏尔也是这么狂欢的
That's how we roll in the Shire.

372
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:35,577
<魔戒>中弗拉多的家乡

373
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,786
来了
Coming.

374
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:51,906
嘿 看见库萨帕里了吗?
Hey,have you seen Koothrappali?

375
00:19:51,906 --> 00:19:53,646
他不在这
He's not here.

376
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:57,296
也许复仇者们把他召走了
Maybe the Avengers summoned him.

377
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,536
他不是神奇漫画里那个雷神 是北欧神话里那个雷神
He's not the Marvel Comics Thor,he's the original Norse god.

378
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:03,016
多谢你的解释
Thank you for the clarification.

379
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:04,306
我本来要送他回家的
I'm supposed to give him a ride home.

380
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:05,906
放心吧 我相信他没事的
Well,I'm sure he'll be fine.

381
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:09,306
他带着锤子呢
He has his hammer.

382
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:19,676
我得承认 你太了不起了
I have to say,you are an amazing man.

383
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,216
温柔 有激情
You're gentle,and passionate.

384
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:28,116
而且 上帝啊 你还是个超好的倾听者
And,my God,you are such a good listener.
