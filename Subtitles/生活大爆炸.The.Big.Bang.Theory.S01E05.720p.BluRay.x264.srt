1
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:05,644
现在我调动步兵师
All right, I'm moving my infantry division...

2
00:00:05,744 --> 00:00:08,714
和指环王中的半兽人兵团
...augmented by a battalion of orcs from Lord of the Rings.

3
00:00:08,814 --> 00:00:10,714
我们从侧翼包夹了田纳西的志愿兵 
We flank the Tennessee volunteers

4
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:14,134
而在北方 我们又一次赢得了葛底斯堡战役
and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.

5
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:15,794
没这么容易 
Not so fast.

6
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:18,444
别忘了 南方还有两个步兵师 
Remember, the South still has two infantry divisions.

7
00:00:18,444 --> 00:00:20,154
再加上超人和哥斯拉
Plus Superman and Godzilla.

8
00:00:20,414 --> 00:00:23,634
半兽人是魔法部队 超人最怕魔法
No, no, no. Orcs are magic. Superman is vulnerable to magic.

9
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:24,584
更别提...
Not to mention

10
00:00:24,684 --> 00:00:28,494
哥斯拉早已被伊利诺伊骑兵和绿巨人消灭
you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.

11
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:30,774
为什么不让罗伯特・李将军冲锋?
Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line

12
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:30,774
罗伯特・李 南北战争时期南军统帅

13
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:32,634
他可以带上湿婆和格涅沙
with Shiva and Ganesh?

14
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:34,754
- 可以点餐了吗? - 稍等 宝贝
-You guys ready to order? -Hang on,honey.

15
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:36,204
湿婆和格涅沙
Shiva and Ganesh,

16
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:38,674
印度教之神? 对抗整个北部联军?
the Hindu gods,against the entire Union army?

17
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:40,524
还有半兽人
And orcs.

18
00:00:40,864 --> 00:00:42,184
我稍候再来
I'll be back.

19
00:00:42,284 --> 00:00:43,244
不好意思
Excuse me.

20
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:46,124
象头神格涅沙擅长清除障碍 湿婆是毁灭之神
Ganesh is the Remover of Obstacles and Shiva is the Destroyer.

21
00:00:46,224 --> 00:00:47,464
当硝烟散尽之时
When the smoke clears

22
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,984
林肯将会一边说着印地语 一边喝南方的薄荷饮料
Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.

23
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:55,364
我老板说你们要么点餐 要么就给他滚蛋
All right,my boss says you have to either order or leave and never come back.

24
00:00:55,464 --> 00:00:58,384
对于做了一早上的举重和有氧锻炼 冒着甜美气息的我
What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite

25
00:00:58,484 --> 00:01:00,364
有什么推荐菜式?
from a morning of weight training and cardio funk?

26
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:01,974
洗澡
A shower.

27
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:05,074
我要个奶酪拼盘
I'll take the Heart Smart platter.

28
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:07,524
好 谢谢你 谢尔顿呢?
All right,thank you,and Sheldon?

29
00:01:07,624 --> 00:01:08,364
我们没在这里吃过
We don't eat here.

30
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:09,614
不知道什么好吃
I don't know what's good.

31
00:01:09,714 --> 00:01:10,664
都很好吃
Well,it's all good.

32
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:12,874
概率上不太可能
Statistically unlikely.

33
00:01:13,284 --> 00:01:14,324
就点一个汉堡
Just get a hamburger.

34
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:15,404
你喜欢汉堡
You like hamburgers.

35
00:01:15,514 --> 00:01:17,654
我喜欢我们常去的那家汉堡店的汉堡
I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers.

36
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:20,974
不能假定我也喜欢这里的汉堡
You can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here.

37
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:22,074
对不起
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:22,174 --> 00:01:23,644
给他一个汉堡
Give him a hamburger.

39
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:24,144
好吧 哪种?
All right,which one?

40
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:25,504
经典汉堡 农家汉堡
The Classic Burger,the Ranch House Burger,

41
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:27,974
烧烤汉堡 柯比汉堡?
the Barbecue Burger,or the Kobe Burger?

42
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:30,134
能不能去大胖汉堡店?
Can't we just go to Big Boy?

43
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:33,114
他们只有一种汉堡 大胖汉堡
They only have one burger... the Big Boy.

44
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:34,724
烧烤汉堡跟大胖汉堡挺像的
Well,the Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.

45
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:37,484
对不起 既然世上已经有大胖汉堡
Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy

46
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:39,914
为什么我们要满足于像大胖汉堡呢?
why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?

47
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:42,964
因为你不在大胖汉堡店!
Because you're not at Big Boy!

48
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:45,104
好吧 那我要烧烤汉堡
Fine,I'll have the Barbecue Burger.

49
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:45,874
我也要这个
Make it two.

50
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:48,724
大胖汉堡店的侍应从不冲被人嚷嚷
Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.

51
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:51,004
- 嘿 莱纳德 - 你们好
-Hey,Leonard. -Hi,guys.

52
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:52,044
你好 莱斯利
Hey. Hi,Leslie.

53
00:01:52,294 --> 00:01:53,774
- 不知道你们会来这里吃饭 - 确实不会
I didn't know you ate here. We don't.

54
00:01:53,874 --> 00:01:56,204
这次是很不愉快的例外
This is a disturbing aberration.

55
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:57,564
莱斯利 他是佩妮
Leslie,this is Penny.

56
00:01:57,664 --> 00:01:59,304
她住在我和谢尔顿的对面
She lives across the hall from Sheldon and me.

57
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:02,754
她走在美的光彩中 像夜晚
And walks in quiet beauty like the night.

58
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:02,754
诗人拜伦的名句

59
00:02:02,854 --> 00:02:05,184
霍华德 我已经说了 别这样
Howard,I've asked you not to do that.

60
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:08,434
莱斯利和我在同个大学做研究
Leslie and I do research together at the university.

61
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:10,924
哇 女科学家
Oh,wow,a girl scientist.

62
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:14,004
没胸 只好多长点大脑
Yep,come for the breasts,stay for the brains.

63
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:15,724
碰见你太好了
So,I'm glad I ran into you.

64
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:18,484
物理系弦乐四重奏还缺一个大提琴
The Physics Department string quartet needs a new cellist.

65
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:19,324
埃利奥特・王怎么啦?
What happened to Elliot Wong?

66
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:22,014
他调到高能辐射课题组了
He switched over to high-energy radiation research

67
00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:25,684
发生一些小意外 其他团员怕坐他身边被辐射
had a little mishap,and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him.

68
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:27,384
你来不来?
So are you in?

69
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:28,674
当然来
Yeah,sure,why not?

70
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,974
太好了 周二去你那里彩排
Great,we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.

71
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:31,944
为什么去我那里?
Why at my place?

72
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:35,984
能源部说我们原来 排练的地方现在是危险区
Yeah,Department of Energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone.

73
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:36,954
很高兴见到你
Nice meeting you.

74
00:02:37,054 --> 00:02:38,394
我也是
Yeah,you,too.

75
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:40,614
莱纳德 不知道你会拉大提琴
Leonard,I didn't know you played the cello.

76
00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:43,054
是啊 我父母觉得给我取名莱纳德
Yeah,my parents felt that naming me Leonard

77
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:45,534
把我扔进大学先修班 
and putting me in Advanced Placement classes

78
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:47,924
还不够把我搞倒
wasn't getting me beaten up enough.

79
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:51,194
你喜欢音乐吗? 我会学架子鼓
If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.

80
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:52,274
真的?
Really?

81
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:01,464
其实我不是太喜欢音乐
I'm actually not that into music.

82
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:05,324
你那个朋友不错  你们俩是不是有点情况?
So,hey,your friend's really cute. Anything going on with you two?

83
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:06,834
莱斯利?
L - Leslie?

84
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:09,024
没有 怎么可能? 
No,no. What,are you kidding?

85
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:12,534
他约过她一次 不过尴尬地失败了
He asked her out once. It was an embarrassing failure.

86
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:13,654
多谢 谢尔顿
Thank you,Sheldon.

87
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:14,304
噢 对不起
Oh,I'm sorry.

88
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:16,554
这个需要保密吗?
Was that supposed to be a secret?

89
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:17,914
哦 太可惜了
Aw,that's too bad.

90
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:20,114
你们本可以做一对甜蜜情侣
You guys'd make a cute couple.

91
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,054
我的天
Oh,dear.

92
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:23,714
怎么了?
What's the matter?

93
00:03:23,814 --> 00:03:24,924
她没问我点什么
She didn't take my order.

94
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:25,854
她怎么问你?
How can she take your order

95
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:28,244
你紧张得连话都不会说
when you're too neurotic to talk to her?

96
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:32,344
尽管如此 这将反映在她的小费上
Nevertheless,this will be reflected in her tip.

97
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:38,034
佩妮说"你们本可以做一对甜蜜情侣" 什么意思?
What did Penny mean,"You'd make a cute couple?"

98
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,774
我想她的意思是 你们两个在一起可以组成情侣
Well,I assume she meant the two of you together would constitute a couple

99
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:43,024
并且令其他人觉得你们甜蜜
that others might consider cute.

100
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:47,084
另一个不太可能的解释是
An alternate and somewhat less likely interpretation

101
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:49,284
你们可以制造一对情侣
is that you could manufacture one.

102
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,474
例如 "快看 莱纳德和莱斯利所生的高德法布夫妻 
As in,"Oh,look,Leonard and Leslie made Mr.and Mrs.Goldfarb.

103
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:55,644
是不是很可爱?"
Aren't they adorable?"

104
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:58,454
如果佩妮不知道莱斯利拒绝过我
If Penny didn't know that Leslie had turned me down,

105
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,434
那么这一句的所指将十分明确 
then it would unambiguously mean

106
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:02,854
即 她(佩妮)认为我应该追她(莱斯利)
that she,Penny,thought I should ask her,Leslie,out

107
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:05,864
表明她(佩妮)对于我 追求她(佩妮)并无兴趣
indicating that she,Penny, had no interest in me asking her,Penny,out.

108
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:08,334
但由于她知道我追过莱斯利
But,because she did know that I had asked Leslie out

109
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:11,284
并且她(莱斯利)已经拒绝我 
and that she,Leslie,had turned me down,

110
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,134
那么她(佩妮)可能只是安慰我
then she,Penny,could be offering consolation.

111
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:18,414
"真可惜 你们本来 可以做一对甜蜜情侣..."
"That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple..."

112
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:23,114
并且暗想 "很好 莱纳德还是单身"
but while thinking:"Good, Leonard remains available."

113
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:26,224
你很幸运 莱纳德
You're a lucky man,Leonard.

114
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:28,784
怎么说?
How so?

115
00:04:28,884 --> 00:04:30,074
听你说话的人
You're talking to one of the three men

116
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:33,194
是西半球仅有的三个 能跟得上你思维的人之一
in the western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.

117
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:36,074
那么 你怎么看?
Well,what do you think?

118
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:38,894
我只是说我能跟上 不代表我有兴趣
I said I could follow it. I didn't say I care.

119
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:42,804
宇宙是个大火炉 *
Our whole universe was in a hot,dense state

120
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:46,944
140亿年前大爆炸 哦稍等 *
Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait!

121
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:47,834
地球开始冷却 *
The Earth began to cool

122
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:50,894
生物开始繁衍 尼安得特尔人发明工具*
The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools

123
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,814
我们建造墙瓦 我们创造金字塔 *
We built the Wall  We built the pyramids

124
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:55,674
数学 科学 历史  揭露奥秘*
Math,Science,History,unraveling the mystery

125
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:57,404
就从宇宙大爆炸开始! *
That all started with a big bang

126
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:58,774
磅
Bang!

127
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:00,774
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第05集
The.Hamburger.Postulate

128
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:12,385
我很欣赏你的指法
I admire your fingering.

129
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,065
谢谢
Thank you.

130
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:18,825
也许你可以在我的"乐器"上演练一下
Maybe sometime you can try that on my instrument.

131
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:28,885
- 晚安兄弟 练得不错 - 谢谢
Good night,guys. Good job. Thanks.

132
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:30,165
下周见
See you next week.

133
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:33,035
挺好玩的 莱斯利 多谢你叫上我
That was fun,Leslie. Thanks for including me.

134
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:33,905
不客气
You're welcome.

135
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:34,695
如果你有兴趣
If you're up for it

136
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:37,125
我们可以练一下中间部分
we could practice that middle section again.

137
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:38,855
当然好
Sure,why not?

138
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:48,025
说说清楚比较好 你知不知道我留下来陪你加练
Just so we're clear,you understand that me hanging back to practice with you

139
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:52,095
是一个铺垫 为了让你知道我是潜在性对象
is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available.

140
00:05:58,685 --> 00:05:59,915
真的?
Really?

141
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:01,875
是的 我随时可以
Yeah,I'm good to go.

142
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:04,235
我以为你对我没兴趣
I thought you weren't interested in me.

143
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:08,685
那是在看到你摆弄两腿之间 那块优雅的木头之前
That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.

144
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,195
你是指大提琴?
You mean my cello?

145
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:14,875
不 那是一个明显下流的双关
No,I mean the obvious,crude,double entendre.

146
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,055
我在勾引你
I'm seducing you.

147
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:20,125
不是吧
No kidding.

148
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:23,735
怎么说呢? 我是有激情的冲动型女人
What can I say? I'm a passionate and impulsive woman.

149
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:26,585
你说呢?
So how about it?

150
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:28,675
这个 呃...
Gee. Uh...

151
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:30,045
因为那个侍应生?
Is it the waitress?

152
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:31,375
佩妮?
Penny?

153
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,595
她怎么了?
What about her?

154
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:34,885
你看她的时候瞳孔放大
I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her.

155
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:38,295
这表明有性吸引力 除非是海洛因成瘾反应
Which,unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.

156
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:42,055
我早餐吃了一个含罂粟籽的百吉饼
Well,I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast.

157
00:06:42,155 --> 00:06:45,085
可能导致阿片碱尿检阳性
Which could cause a positive urine test for opiates

158
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:46,855
但肯定不至于扩大瞳孔
but certainly not dilate my pupils.

159
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:50,005
所以...我不知道为什么要说起这个
So I guess there was no point in bringing it up.

160
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:52,655
你和那个侍应生
You and the waitress then.

161
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:53,965
没有 没有
No... no.

162
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:56,925
我和佩妮之间没什么
There's nothing going on between Penny and me.

163
00:06:57,025 --> 00:07:00,405
所以你可以建立性关系咯?
So you're open to a sexual relationship?

164
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:02,505
可以可以 我想
Yeah,yeah,I guess I am.

165
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:03,295
好
Good.

166
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:06,045
很好
Yeah,it is. It is good.

167
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:09,365
要现在就开始?
Did you want to start now?

168
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:11,625
演完这一章吧
Why don't we finish the section first?

169
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:12,725
好的
Oh,okay.

170
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:15,515
音乐前戏 不错
A little musical foreplay. Terrific.

171
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:38,785
- 我准备好了 - 我也是
I'm g-good to go. Me,too.

172
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:52,085
谢尔顿 怎么了?
Oh,hey,Sheldon. What's going on?

173
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:55,085
我需要符号学方面的帮助
I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.

174
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:56,275
什么?
I'm sorry?

175
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,395
符号学 研究符号和象征
Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols.

176
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:02,475
是语言学基本理论的分支
It's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.

177
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:06,765
亲爱的 我知道你以为自己在解释
Okay,sweetie, I know you think you're explaing yourself

178
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:09,495
其实你真的没有
but you're really not.

179
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:13,235
跟我来
Just come with me.

180
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:18,355
怎样?
Well?

181
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:19,535
什么怎样?
Well,what?

182
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,605
什么意思?
What does it mean?

183
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,855
得了 你上过大学的
Oh,come on,you went to college.

184
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:26,335
是的 我那是才11岁上
Yes,but I was 11.

185
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:28,495
好吧 是这样
All right,look,

186
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:31,985
门把手上挂条领带 意思是里面的人不想被打扰
a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed

187
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:36,395
因为...他们 在忙活 
because,they're... you know,gettin' busy.

188
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:39,365
就是说莱纳德跟个女孩在房间里?
So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there?

189
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:41,335
不然就是他丢了衣架 
Well,either that or he's lost his tie rack

190
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:44,835
并且真的疯狂地喜欢布莱恩・亚当斯
and gotten really into Bryan Adams.

191
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:48,765
莱纳德 你这了不起的野兽!
Oh,Leonard,you magnificent beast.

192
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:53,178
我们真不该站这了
We really shouldn't be standing here.

193
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,428
太尴尬了
This is very awkward.

194
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:00,918
不会吧 莱纳德以前也带女孩回来过 是吧?
Oh,come on,Leonard's had girls over before,right?

195
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:05,828
有的 但通常要计划 求爱 并且提前通知...
Oh,yes,but there's usually planning, courtship,advance notice...

196
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:10,668
就像上次 我才有时间预订去北极看日食的旅行
Last time,I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.

197
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,068
就应为你室友要做爱 你就得离开这个国家?
You had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?

198
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:18,608
不是一定要 时间上完全是个巧合
I didn't have to. The dates just happened to coincide.

199
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:24,148
你知道里面那是谁吗?
So,do you know who's in there?

200
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:26,048
里面有莱纳德
Well,there's Leonard.

201
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:34,118
跟他在一起的要么是莱斯利・温克 要不就是30年代的黑帮
And he's either with Leslie Winkle or a 1930s gangster.

202
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:38,858
他真不错
Hmm,good for him.

203
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:42,018
恭喜莱纳德
Good for Leonard.

204
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:43,888
好吧 晚安
Okay,g'night.

205
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:45,418
等等 别走!
No,no,wait,hold on.

206
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,868
怎么了?
What's the matter?

207
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:49,238
我不知道这种情况下标准做法是什么
I don't know what the protocol is here.

208
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:53,068
我该留下来? 还是出去?
Do I stay? Do I leave?

209
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:56,298
他们出来时 要递上提神饮料吗?
Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?

210
00:09:58,018 --> 00:09:59,988
谢尔顿 你问错人了
Gee,Sheldon,you're asking the wrong girl.

211
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:03,248
我通常在领带的另一边
I'm usually on the other side of the tie.

212
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:24,768
你好 莱纳德?
Hi,Leonard?

213
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:31,158
是我 谢尔顿
It's me,Sheldon...

214
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:33,938
我在客厅
In the living room.

215
00:10:34,238 --> 00:10:36,818
我就想告诉你 我看到领带了
I just... I wanted you to know I saw the tie.

216
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:39,198
消息收到
Message received.

217
00:10:42,118 --> 00:10:43,898
不客气
You're welcome.

218
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:46,228
继续吧
Carry on.

219
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:48,688
向莱斯利问好
Give my best to Leslie.

220
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:27,527
大胖汉堡...
Big Boy...

221
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:54,627
有人动过我的写字板
Someone touched my board.

222
00:11:57,977 --> 00:12:00,307
天啊 我的写字板!
Oh,God,my board!

223
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,297
莱纳德! 莱纳德!
Leonard! Leonard!

224
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,427
怎么了?
Hey,what's the matter?

225
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,857
有人改过我的公式!
My equations,someone's tampered with my equations.

226
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:11,497
- 你确定? - 很确定!
Are you sure? Of course I'm sure.

227
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,307
看看量子色动力学的贝塔函数
Look at the beta function of quantum chromodynamics.

228
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:15,937
符号被改了!
The sign's been changed.

229
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:17,707
对哦
Oh,yeah.

230
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:19,837
那不正好解决了你的问题吗?
But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?

231
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:22,497
你疯了吗? 你傻了吗?
Are you insane? Are you out of your mind?

232
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:23,477
你...哦 瞧瞧
Are you... hey,look.

233
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,187
这正好解决了我的问题
That fixes the problem I've been having.

234
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:28,977
不客气
You're welcome.

235
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,587
你干的?
Youdid this?

236
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:34,877
我起来喝水的时候发现的
Yeah,I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water.

237
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:36,997
我改了 这样就能证明夸克 
So I fixed it and now you can show that quarks

238
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:38,877
在高能状态下是渐进自由的
are asymptotically free at high energies.

239
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:40,357
很赞吧?
Pretty cool,huh?

240
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:44,167
"赞"?
"Cool"?

241
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,037
我要去实验室了
Listen,I've got to get to the lab.

242
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:48,107
昨晚很棒 谢了
Thanks for a great night.

243
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:50,977
谢谢 上班见
Thank you. I'll see you at work.

244
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:53,757
等等!
Hold on. Hold on!

245
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:54,297
怎么?
What?

246
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:56,567
谁说你可以碰我的写字板的?
Who told you you could touch my board?

247
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:57,487
没人
No one.

248
00:12:57,587 --> 00:12:59,867
我不会去你家碰你的写字板
Yeah,I don't come into your house and touch your board.

249
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:02,827
我的板子上没有错误的公式啊
There are no incorrect equations on my board.

250
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:07,797
你真是...
Oh,that is so...

251
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:09,347
太...
so...

252
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:12,097
对不起 我要走了
I'm sorry,I've got to run.

253
00:13:12,197 --> 00:13:14,547
如果你想好形容词 短信发我
If you come up with an adjective,text me.

254
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:19,167
不体谅
Inconsiderate.

255
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:21,847
就是这个词 "不体谅"
That is the adjective,"inconsiderate. "

256
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:25,577
你就算一直瞪着写字板 谢尔顿
You can stare at your board all day,Sheldon.

257
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:26,877
她还是对的
She's still going to be right.

258
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:28,877
我不是在瞪 我在思索
I'm not staring, I'm mulling.

259
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:31,167
- 嘿 莱纳德 - 嗨
Oh,hey,Leonard. Oh,hi.

260
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:32,467
那么...
So...

261
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:34,657
如何呀?
...how's it going?

262
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:39,107
还好
Pretty good.

263
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:40,957
只是还好?
Just pretty good?

264
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:43,877
我觉得是很好呀
I'd think you were doing very good.

265
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:48,957
"还" "很"只是描述"好"的变化程度 并没有客观的范围
Pretty,very... there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of "good. "

266
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:50,907
你为什么这么问?
Why do you ask?

267
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:55,917
小鸟告诉我昨晚你跟莱斯利勾搭上了
Well,a little bird told me that you and Leslie hooked up last night.

268
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,157
谢尔顿!
Sheldon!

269
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:03,027
你是来真的? 你喜欢她吗?
So,is it serious? Do you like her?

270
00:14:03,157 --> 00:14:04,737
我不...
I don't...

271
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:08,297
那是两个不同的问题
Th-th-that's really two different questions.

272
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:09,757
我不是...
Uh,I'm not...

273
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:11,677
谢尔顿 我们得走了!
Sheldon,we have to go!

274
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:15,937
对于一个刚进行过性交的人来说 你真是出奇的紧张啊
Boy,you're wound awfully tight for a man who's just had sexual intercourse.

275
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:21,207
好吧 下次再说吧 不过我真为你高兴 莱纳德
All right,well,I'll talk to you later, but I am so happy for you,Leonard.

276
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,187
谢谢
Thank you.

277
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:29,597
她为我高兴是什么意思?
What did she mean she's happy for me?

278
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:31,857
她高兴我现在有伴了?
Is she happy that I'm seeing someone?

279
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:33,967
还是因为我开心所以她高兴?
Or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy?

280
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:36,657
如果一个人喜欢别人 就会希望那人开心吧?
Because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy.

281
00:14:36,757 --> 00:14:40,687
就算那人开心的理由让前者伤心
Even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy.

282
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:43,387
因为开心的后者
Because the second person,though happy,

283
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:46,817
就不能跟前者成为情侣了
is now romantically unavailable to the first person.

284
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:51,657
你意识到我可能要跟你的性交对象 分享诺贝尔奖吗?
Do you realize I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?

285
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:56,087
你知道吗?
You know what?

286
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:58,777
我真可笑
I'm being ridiculous.

287
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:00,717
谁在乎佩妮怎么想?
Who cares what Penny thinks?

288
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:02,267
莱斯利是个很棒的女孩
Leslie is a terrific girl.

289
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:03,147
漂亮
She's attractive.

290
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:03,987
我们喜欢对方
We like each other.

291
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:05,717
她还超级聪明
She's extremely intelligent...

292
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:07,617
哪有很聪明
She's not that intelligent.

293
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:09,037
她修正了你的方程式
She fixed your equation.

294
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:11,037
- 那是走运 - 你根本不相信运气这种事
She got lucky. You don't believe in luck.

295
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:13,957
我不信 但她也可以走运
I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky.

296
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,637
不管怎样 我现在有机会和莱斯利发展一段真正的恋情
Regardless,I have a chance at a real relationship with Leslie.

297
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:19,117
我不会就这么放弃的
I'm not going to pass that up for some

298
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:21,527
而只为了跟一个可能希望 也可能不希望我和别人开心的女人
hypothetical future of happiness with a woman

299
00:15:21,627 --> 00:15:23,907
拥有一段假想的幸福未来
who may or may not want me to be happy,

300
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,287
而现在 那个别人已经让我很开心了
with a woman who is currently making me happy.

301
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:29,537
- 莱纳德...  - 啊?
Leonard... Yeah?

302
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,487
我还是没兴趣
I still don't care.

303
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:42,187
- 嗨 莱斯利 - 小心 莱纳德
Hey,Leslie. Careful,Leonard.

304
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:45,657
液氮 华氏零下320度
Liquid nitrogen,320 degrees below zero.

305
00:15:53,697 --> 00:15:56,217
你为什么要砸碎速冻香蕉?
Why are smashing a flash-frozen bana?

306
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:59,597
我有一碗麦片 又找不到刀子
Because I got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn't find a knife. Oh.

307
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:02,937
那么...
So anyway...

308
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:05,317
你好
Hello.

309
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:09,557
你在干嘛?
Uh,what are you doing?

310
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:11,887
跟你亲近一下
Just extending the intimacy.

311
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:14,587
想溜进辐射实验室 
Hey,do you want to slip over to the radiation lab

312
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:17,197
一起洗个去污澡吗?
and share a decontamination shower?

313
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:24,287
好吧 你觉得我们俩之间发生了什么事?
Okay,uh,what exactly do you think's going on between us?

314
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:29,357
不知道 不过我可能就要知道那香蕉什么感觉了
I'm not sure,but I think I'm about to discover how the bana felt.

315
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:35,607
莱纳德 我们都不是神经学家 
Listen,Leonard,neither of us are neuroscientists

316
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,717
但是都了解性的生物化学原理
but we both understand the biochemistry of sex.

317
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:41,417
脑中的多巴胺在神经键中释放 造成快感
I mean,dopamine in our brains is released across synapses,causing pleasure.

318
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,947
在老鼠大脑里插入电极 再给它个高潮按键
You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button,

319
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:46,487
它会一直按着那个键直到死
he'll push that thing until he starves to death.

320
00:16:47,187 --> 00:16:48,907
谁不会呢?
Well,who wouldn't?

321
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:51,337
我们跟老鼠的区别就在于
Well,the only difference between us and the rat

322
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:53,837
我们不能在我们视丘下部置入电极
is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus.

323
00:16:53,937 --> 00:16:55,587
所以你就派上用场了
That's where you come in.

324
00:16:57,597 --> 00:17:00,307
很高兴能起到作用
Yeah,well,I'm just glad to be a part of it.

325
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:03,057
那么现在如何?
So what happens now?

326
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:06,537
不知道你性欲多强烈 但我到新年之前应该都够了
Well,I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Year's.

327
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:12,477
好吧 谢谢
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

328
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:14,357
谢谢你
Thank you.

329
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:18,747
你想定下新年的计划吗?
You want to make plans for New Year's?

330
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,197
莱纳德 拜托了 你噎到我了
Whoa,Leonard,please. You're smothering me.

331
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:22,177
抱歉
Oh. Sorry.

332
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:23,937
瞧瞧
Hey,look.

333
00:17:24,037 --> 00:17:26,397
这不是种马博士吗!
It's Dr. Stud!

334
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:28,467
什么博士?
Dr. What?

335
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,207
博客界的人都因为你跟莱斯利
The blogosphere is a-buzzin'with news of you

336
00:17:30,307 --> 00:17:34,977
奏响的嘿休小夜曲兴奋不已呢!
and Leslie Winkle makingeine kleine bang-bangmusik.

337
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,927
这事怎么传上网的?
What? How did it get on the Internet?

338
00:17:37,027 --> 00:17:38,507
我放上去的
I put it there.

339
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,097
你怎么知道的?
Well,how did you know about it?

340
00:17:41,197 --> 00:17:43,107
小鸟告诉我们的
A little bird told us.

341
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:46,777
很明显 你是头野兽
Apparently,you are a magnificent beast.

342
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,747
那倒是真的
That part's true.

343
00:17:56,651 --> 00:17:58,951
我想我以前误解这家餐厅了
You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant.

344
00:17:59,051 --> 00:17:59,781
不是吧
No kidding.

345
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:00,771
我不想冒险
I don't want to go out on a limb,

346
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,211
但我可能找到了新的周二汉堡包
but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.

347
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:09,201
原来的周二汉堡会很伤心的
Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so brokenhearted.

348
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:10,861
早想到了
Way ahead of you.

349
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:12,681
我想把"大胖汉堡"挪到周四
I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays,

350
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:15,151
放弃"汤植园" (一家自助餐厅)
and just dropping Souplantation.

351
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:17,561
- 真的? - 对
Really? Yeah.

352
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:19,421
我总是搞不懂这名字
The name always confused me anyway.

353
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:21,041
汤植园
Souplantation.

354
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:23,001
汤可没法种植出来
You can't grow soup.

355
00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:28,091
如何呀?
So,how's everything?

356
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,281
棒极了
Mmm! Terrific.

357
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:31,561
你会很高兴的看到 我打算每周二晚上都来这
You'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night

358
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:33,141
在可预见的将来 
for the foreseeable future.

359
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:36,061
真的? 太好了~
Really? Oh,yay!

360
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:40,071
如果要永久订下这张台 要跟谁谈?
Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?

361
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:43,721
不知道 心理医生吧?
Um... I don't know... a psychiatrist?

362
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:46,151
嘿
So,hey

363
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:48,991
你和莱斯利如何?
how are things with you and Leslie?

364
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:52,861
说实话 我认为是没戏了
Oh,to be honest, I don't think it's going to work out.

365
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:55,561
啊 太糟了
Oh. Oh,that's too bad.

366
00:18:55,661 --> 00:18:56,801
别担心
Well,hey,don't worry.

367
00:18:56,901 --> 00:19:00,041
我相信会有合适你的人的
I'm sure there's someone out there who's just right for you.

368
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:05,851
她那么说什么意思?
What did she mean by that?!

369
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:08,001
是普通的安慰语?
Was that just a generic platitude,

370
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:10,781
还是吸引我注意的微妙暗示?
or was that a subtle bid for attention?

371
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:15,481
你知道这个比大胖汉堡强的原因吗?
You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy?

372
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:19,161
这是单层的 大胖汉堡是双层
This is a single-decker hamburger, whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.

373
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:23,181
这个汉堡的肉 面包和调料的比例 更令人满意
This has a much more satisfying meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.

374
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,621
你在听我说话吗?
Are you even listening to me?

375
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:26,651
当然 在听
Of course,I'm listening.

376
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:29,891
废话+关于佩妮无望的幻想+废话
Blah,blah,hopeless Penny delusion,blah,blah,blah.

377
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:33,791
那好吧
Okay,then.

378
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:39,171
你知道 汤的配料是可以种植的
You know,you can grow the ingredients for soup.
