1
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:09,508
关于瞬间转移有一个问题
Here's the problem with teleportation.

2
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:14,708
折磨我吧
Lay it on me.

3
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:16,828
假设我们可以发明一个设备
Assuming a device could be invented

4
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:18,678
它能在某一地点
Which would identify the quantum state of matter

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,418
确定某一个体的量子结构
Of an individual in one location

6
00:00:20,428 --> 00:00:23,958
并把其图像传送到另一地点再重新拼接到一起
And transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly,

7
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,018
你便用不着传送这个个体
You would not have actually transported the individual.

8
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:28,248
你就能在某一地点摧毁他
You would have destroyed him in one location

9
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:30,668
然后在另一地点重造他
And recreated him in another.

10
00:00:32,288 --> 00:00:34,058
真神奇啊
How about that.

11
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:36,918
就我个人来说  我永远都不会用传送器
Personally, I would never use a transporter,

12
00:00:36,928 --> 00:00:39,008
因为原本的谢尔顿
Because the original sheldon would have to be

13
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:42,078
一定要被分解才能创造一个新的谢尔顿
Disintegrated in order to create a new sheldon.

14
00:00:43,088 --> 00:00:44,598
新的谢尔顿在任一方面
Would the new sheldon be in any way

15
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:47,078
会比旧的谢尔顿好吗
An improvement on the old sheldon?

16
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:50,478
不会  还是一模一样的
No, he would be exactly the same.

17
00:00:50,588 --> 00:00:52,308
这就是个问题
That is a problem.

18
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:54,518
你也看出问题来了吧
So you see it too.

19
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:55,798
霍夫斯塔德博士
Dr. hofstadter.

20
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,988
库珀博士
Dr. cooper.

21
00:00:56,998 --> 00:00:58,558
盖博豪瑟博士
Dr. gablehauser. dr. gablehauser.

22
00:00:58,568 --> 00:01:01,018
先生们  允许我向你们介绍丹尼斯・金
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet dennis kim.

23
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:04,308
丹尼斯可是非常吃香的准博士
Dennis is a highly sought-after doctoral candidate,

24
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:06,198
我们希望他能在这里完成他的研究生论文
And we're hopingto have him do his graduate work here.

25
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,728
研究生论文  非常不错啊
Graduate work. very impressive.

26
00:01:07,738 --> 00:01:09,778
而他只有15岁而已
And he's only 15 years old.

27
00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:13,638
不错嘛  我14岁就开始我的研究生学业
Not bad-- i, myself, started graduate school at 14.

28
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:15,538
我浪费了一年  因为我和家人
Well, I lost a year while my family

29
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:17,888
从地道逃出朝鲜花了一年时间
Was tunneling out of north korea.

30
00:01:19,738 --> 00:01:22,728
金发球占先(网球术语)
Advantage Kim.

31
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:24,078
我想你们能
I thought maybe you boys

32
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:25,338
带丹尼斯到处转转
Could show dennis around.

33
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:26,368
让他看看为什么这里会是
Let him see why we're

34
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,808
全国最好的物理研究所
The best physics research facility in the country.

35
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:30,078
我已经知道你们不是了
I already know you're not.

36
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:31,928
你们没有OSG联盟的计算机
You don't have an open science grid computer

37
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:34,668
或是自由电子激光器  并且这里的
Or a free electron laser, and the string theory research

38
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,398
弦理论研究也已经是强弩之末
Being done here is nothing but a dead end.

39
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,138
不好意思  那正是我的研究项目
Excuse me, that is my research,

40
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:40,058
从任何角度来说都还不是强弩之末
And it is by no means a dead end.

41
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:41,928
很明显你现在还没发现
Well, obviously you don't see it yet,

42
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:43,908
不过相信我  有一天你会的
But trust me, you will.

43
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:47,668
丹尼斯  我们已经讨论过这些了
Dennis, we've discussed this.

44
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:50,238
我们正在更新我们的设备
We're in the process of updating our equipment,

45
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:52,418
我们欢迎你加入我们一起研究
And we welcome your input on our research goals,

46
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:54,348
并且我们已经同意说即使你想
And we've agreed to look the other way if you want

47
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:56,368
花20%你吸引来的助学金
To use up to 20% of the grant money you attract

48
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:59,038
把你的爷爷从平壤偷渡过来
To smuggle your grandfather out of pyongyang.

49
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:02,608
我们要留下他  孩子们
We want him here, boys.

50
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:03,778
看你们了
Make it happen.

51
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:04,528
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

52
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:05,648
你尽管放心
You can count on us.

53
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:06,458
看我们的
We're on it.

54
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:08,758
你说"强弩之末"到底是什么意思?
What the hell do you mean, "dead end"?

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,468
我的意思是  虚真空上的全部地表
I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums

56
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:13,038
在弦理论里相当于
In string theory could be as large as ten

57
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:14,558
其10到500次幂的大小
To the five hundredth power.

58
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,958
再说  看  巧克力奶
In addition-- ooh, look, chocolate milk.

59
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,608
我有了不祥的预感
I sense a disturbance in the force.

60
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:25,248
我感到很不妙啊
A bad feeling I have about this.

61
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,566
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第12集
The.Jerusalem.Duality

62
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,809
丹尼斯  你来美国多长时间了?
So, dennis, how long have you been in america?

63
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:54,879
一年半了
A year and a half.

64
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:55,609
真的啊
No kidding.

65
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:56,729
你英文说得很好啊
You speak english really well.

66
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,359
你也是
So do you.

67
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:00,589
就是你好像老喜欢
Except for your tendency to end

68
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,069
把介词放在句尾
Sentences with prepositions.

69
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,629
你说什么在?
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:08,799
例如这句
That.

71
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,319
他没说错
He's not wrong.

72
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,899
好吧
All right...

73
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:14,189
这就是我的办公室
And this is my office.

74
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,149
这是参观的一部分吗
Is this part of the tour?

75
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,019
不是  再见
Nope. good-bye.

76
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:19,919
别这样  谢尔顿  我们还没带他看过什么地方呢
Come on, sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.

77
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:21,429
好吧
All right.

78
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,859
这是我的书桌
This is my desk.

79
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,939
这些是我的书  这是我的门
These are my books; this is my door.

80
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:27,459
出去请随手关门  再见
Please close it behind you. good-bye.

81
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,019
看来你在做关于
Looks like you're doing work

82
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:31,349
量子循环的修正
In quantum loop corrections.

83
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:32,379
观察力很敏锐
Keen observation.

84
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:34,159
再见
Good-bye.

85
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:36,609
你知道你是哪儿错了  是吧
You see where you went wrong, don't you?

86
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,369
里奥纳德
Leonard?

87
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:39,979
什么
Yeah?

88
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:41,949
带他出去
Get him out.

89
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:42,749
走吧  丹尼斯
Come on, dennis.

90
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,949
我带你去娱乐室
I'll show you the recreation center.

91
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,299
那里有些健身器材
They've got nautilus equipment.

92
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,749
你看我像练举重的人吗
Do I look like I lift weights?

93
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,279
举不了很重吧
Not heavy ones.

94
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:52,439
令我吃惊的是你竟然没考虑
It's startling to me you haven't considered

95
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:55,499
洛伦兹不变量和场论步骤
A lorentz invariant or field theory approach.

96
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:57,249
你认为我没考虑吗
You think I haven't considered it?

97
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,429
你真的认为我没考虑过吗
You really think I haven't considered it?

98
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,289
你考虑到了吗
Have you considered it?

99
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:03,259
带他出去  里奥纳德
Get him out, leonard.

100
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:04,669
走吧  丹尼斯
Come on, dennis.

101
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,879
我带你参观辐射研究室
I'll show you the radiation lab.

102
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:10,109
哇  你赢了史蒂文森奖?
Wow, you won the stevenson award?

103
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,039
是的
Yes.

104
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,469
事实上  我是历史上年纪最小的获奖人
In fact, I am the youngest person ever to win it.

105
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,619
真的吗  几岁?
Really? how old?

106
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,579
14岁半
Fourteen and a half.

107
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,489
那你"曾是"历史上年纪最小的获奖人
Hm, you were the youngest person ever to win it.

108
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,509
是不是感觉像看着一面
It's like looking into an obnoxious

109
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,229
另人讨厌的镜子?
Little mirror, isn't it?

110
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:34,389
这个真的很好吃吧
This is really delicious, isn't it?

111
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:40,779
仍旧只有醉了的时候才能跟我说话  是吧
Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh?

112
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:46,059
亲爱的  你被伤害得太深了
Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.

113
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,509
我也被伤害了
Hey, I'm damaged, too.

114
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,099
给霍华德一个拥抱怎样?
How about a hug for howie?

115
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:55,299
当然可以  拉杰  抱抱霍华德
Sure. raj, hug howard.

116
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,039
有什么事要和大家分享吗
Something you'd like to share?

117
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,229
可能是  一个悲情故事?
A tale of woe, perhaps?

118
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:06,989
15岁
Fifteen years old.

119
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:10,999
丹尼斯・金才15岁就已经能纠正我的研究成果了
Dennis Kim's 15 years old, and he's already correcting my work.

120
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,819
今天  我从沃尔夫冈・阿玛多伊斯・莫扎特变成了...
Today, I went from being wolfgang amadeus mozart, to...

121
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,219
你知道  另一个人
You know, that other guy.

122
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,229
安东尼奥・萨利埃雷?(想除掉莫扎特的人)
Antonio salieri?

123
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,949
天呐  现在就连你也比我聪明了
Oh god, now even you're smarter than me.

124
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,359
谢尔顿  你要知道
You know, sheldon, you don't have

125
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:24,889
你并没有那么多朋友
So many friends that you can afford

126
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,029
可以留给你来侮辱
To start insulting them.

127
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,719
吃饭吧  谢尔顿  你会感觉好点的
Just eat, sheldon, you'll feel better.

128
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,239
还浪费食物干吗
Why waste food?

129
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,769
在德州  如果一只奶牛没奶了
In texas, when a cow goes dry,

130
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,869
他们就不继续喂它了  他们会把它带出去
They don't keep feeding it, they just take her out

131
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,029
对准脑门来一枪
And shoot her between the eyes.

132
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:38,589
我糊涂了
I'm confused.

133
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,959
谢尔顿没奶了?
Did sheldon stop giving milk?

134
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:43,999
你不能被这么个小孩给惹毛啊
You can't let this kid get to you.

135
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,189
你一直都知道有一天会出现个人
You always knew that someday someone would come along

136
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,519
既比你年轻又比你聪明
Who was younger and smarter.

137
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:49,429
没错  但我设想的是在我死了
Yes, but I assumed I would've been dead

138
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,089
几百年后  并且他的名字旁边
Hundreds of years and that there'd be

139
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:54,379
会有个星号  因为他是个半机械人
An asterisk by his name because he'd be a cyborg.

140
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:56,869
这么说你现在有了个小小的竞争对手
So you've got a little competition.

141
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,709
我真不明白这有什么严重的
I really don't see what the big deal is.

142
00:05:58,719 --> 00:05:59,859
你当然不明白
Well, of course you don't.

143
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:02,459
你从来没有成为顶尖过
You've never excelled at anything.

144
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:05,519
我不明白  最开始
I don't understand-- exactly how

145
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:07,849
他怎么会交到任何朋友的?
Did he get any friends in the first place?

146
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,749
因为我们喜欢里奥纳德
We liked leonard.

147
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:14,719
你现在想怎么样  谢尔顿  放弃吗
Well, what are you gonna do, sheldon, just give up?

148
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:16,069
是的
Yes.

149
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,489
当他花了一辈子所完成的成果
It's what a rational person does

150
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:19,569
被一个刚过青春期的亚洲神童否决时
When his entire life's work is invalidated

151
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,349
任何理性的人都会这么做
By a postpubescent asian wunderkind.

152
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:24,999
他停止他徒劳的努力
He ceases his fruitless efforts,

153
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,839
他捐献他的身体给科学研究
He donates his body to scientific research,

154
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,809
现在他等待死亡
And he waits to die.

155
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:32,389
我现在又糊涂了
You know, I'm confused again.

156
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,919
是他要等死呢  还是我们可以
Is he waiting, or do we get

157
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:36,149
对准他脑门来一枪?
To shoot him between the eyes?

158
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:42,309
我决定了  你说的对
I've decided you're right.

159
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,109
我的事业还没有完结
My career is not over.

160
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:44,989
好极了!
Great!

161
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:46,539
但既然丹尼斯・金
But since the arrival of dennis kim

162
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:48,169
已经诠释了我的研究是徒劳的
Has rendered my research pointless,

163
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:50,749
那我需要找些别的东西来研究
I just have to find something else to focus on.

164
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,699
好极了!
Great!

165
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:55,149
所以我决定我要跟你合作
So I've decided I'm going to collaborate with you.

166
00:06:57,849 --> 00:06:59,489
"好极了"
Great.

167
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:02,219
你现在具体在做什么?
So what exactly is it you do?

168
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,379
我知道你常常说起
I know you chatter on about it all the time,

169
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,609
但我从没怎么注意听
But I've never really paid attention.

170
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:09,409
好  现在我在设计一个实验
Okay, well, right now I'm designing an experiment

171
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,419
来研究海平面上宇宙辐射的软性分立
To study the soft component of cosmic radiation

172
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:13,369
但是我真的不需要任何帮助
At sea level, but I really don't need any help.

173
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,239
你肯定需要
Oh, sure you do.

174
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,619
看原理图  这个东西是什么?
Now, see, what's this here in the schematic?

175
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:18,899
那个是激光阵列吗
Is that a laser array?

176
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:21,129
是的
Yes. now, hm...

177
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,649
如果你用氩激光器而不是氦氖
What happens if you use argon lasers

178
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:27,329
会怎么样?
Instead of helium-neon?

179
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:28,809
那样就会爆炸
It would blow up.

180
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,079
你肯定吗  比较肯定
Are you sure? pretty sure.

181
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,739
"比较肯定"可不是很科学
"pretty sure" is not very scientific.

182
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:34,189
你平常都这样吗?
Is this how you normally work?

183
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,889
只是预感和猜测结果?
Just hunches and guesses and stuff?

184
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:40,259
好了  谢尔顿  我理解你现在
Okay, sheldon, I understand that you're

185
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:41,929
正经历着事业上的小小危机
Going through a bit of a career crisis,

186
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,639
你在寻找一些其他的领域
You're searching for some other area

187
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,869
让你可以感觉自己有价值并有建设性
Where you can feel valuable and productive,

188
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,069
但是我需要告诉你一些事
But I need to tell you something,

189
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,529
你希望你仔细听清楚
And I want you to listen carefully.

190
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:49,429
好吧
All right.

191
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,579
走开
Go away.

192
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,779
如果你担心会和我共享这荣誉的话
If you're concerned about sharing credit with me,

193
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:58,149
你的名字可以放在前面...我走
Your name can go first-- I'm going.

194
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:05,449
是个小的  褐色的袋子  妈!
It's a small, brown paper bag, ma!

195
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,539
我现在正瞅着呢
I'm looking in it right now.

196
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,829
我骗你干嘛?
Why would I make that up?

197
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,679
里面根本就没有巧克力点心
There's no ding dong in it.

198
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,999
明天给我两份点心有什么用  我今天又吃不到
How are two ding dongs tomorrow gonna help me today?

199
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:21,999
那么...
So...

200
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:23,969
这就是工程是吧
This is engineering, huh?

201
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:25,779
我一会再跟您说
I'll talk to you later.

202
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:27,279
工程
Engineering.

203
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:29,349
由这些杰出的半职业的工人
Where the noble semiskilled laborers

204
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:32,259
来完成那些思考和梦想者的设想
Execute the vision of those who think and dream.

205
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:35,579
好啊  科学小矮人
Hello, oompah loompahs of science.

206
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,079
谢尔顿  你来这里做什么
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

207
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:41,889
我就过来打声招呼
I just came by to say hello.

208
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:43,519
我在这个研究室工作了3年
I've been in this lab for three years.

209
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:44,979
你从来没到这里来打过招呼
You've never come by to say hello.

210
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:48,059
因为在此之前  我有更重要的事要做
Well, up until now, I've had better things to do.

211
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:50,769
我们今天要做什么?
So, what are we making today?

212
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:53,119
一个小的支撑有效载荷结构
A small payload support structure

213
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,139
提供给欧洲的科学实验方案
For a european science experimental package

214
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:56,809
这个会装在下一艘太空船里
That's going up on the next space shuttle.

215
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:58,809
真的?  这东西怎么工作?
Really? how does it work?

216
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:00,379
当完成之后  这个将会放在
When this is done, it will be attached

217
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,479
有效载重舱上  还有传感器
To the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus

218
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:04,389
也会被装上
Will rest on it.

219
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,889
就是个架子
So it's a shelf.

220
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:14,739
不是  你不明白  在加速过程中
No, you don't understand-- during acceleration,

221
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,059
它需要保持完全的水平并且提供...
It needs to stay perfectly level and provide...

222
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:19,279
好吧  它就是个架子
Yeah, okay, it's a shelf.

223
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:20,999
我注意到了你用的是钛
Now, I notice you're using titanium.

224
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:23,779
你有否考虑过用碳纳米管?
Did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes?

225
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:26,539
它们更轻  更便宜  并且具有两倍的抗张强度
They're lighter, cheaper, and have twice the tensile strength.

226
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:27,759
谢尔顿
Sheldon,

227
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,479
我办公室里有这么张证书
There's a diploma in my office

228
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:32,349
上面写着我获得了工程硕士学位
That says I have a master's in engineering.

229
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,629
并且这里还有张你妈妈给你写的字条
And you also have a note from your mother

230
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,979
上面写着  "我爱你  小水泡"
That says, "i love you, bubula."

231
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:39,819
但是哪个都不是能证明
But neither of those is a cogent argument

232
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,069
钛比纳米管好的有力论点
For titanium over nanotubes.

233
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:43,859
-谢尔顿  -干吗
Sheldon? yes?

234
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:46,149
走开!
Go away!

235
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:48,959
里奥纳德叫你这么说的吗
Did leonard tell you to say that?

236
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:51,419
不是  我自己想出来的
No, I thought of it all by myself.

237
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:55,979
不能这么巧吧
That can't be a coincidence.

238
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:59,139
这里肯定有些因果的联系我没想到
There must be some causal link I'm missing.

239
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,299
走开!
Go away!

240
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,749
真是奇怪  真是奇怪
Curiouser and curiouser.

241
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:19,948
他在这吗
Is he here?

242
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,088
如果他在  我就不会在了
If he were, I wouldn't be.

243
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:24,018
你知道他干了什么吗
Do you know what he did?

244
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:25,388
他看着我做了10分钟
He watched me work for ten minutes,

245
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:26,868
然后开始设计一个可以
And then started to design a simple piece

246
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:29,208
取代我的简易软件
Of software that could replace me.

247
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:32,308
这有可能吗
Is that even possible?

248
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:34,358
他确实做到了
As it turns out, yes.

249
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,878
里奥纳德  我们需要干点什么了
Something's got to be done about him, leonard.

250
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:38,898
什么呢?
Like what?

251
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:40,388
他永远都不可能接受
He'll never be able to cope with the fact

252
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:42,128
一个15岁的小孩比他更聪明
That some 15-year-old kid is smarter

253
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,588
比他更有成就
And more accomplished than he is.

254
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:46,228
如果这个小孩发生了什么意外
Well, what if something were to happen to this boy

255
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:48,758
然后再也不会对谢尔顿造成威胁呢
So he was no longer a threat to sheldon?

256
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:52,478
那我们的问题就解决了
Then our problem would be solved.

257
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:56,818
等等  你们是在讨论谋杀丹尼斯・金吗
Hang on, are we talking about murdering dennis kim?

258
00:10:57,318 --> 00:10:59,348
我不是说不行
I'm not saying no.

259
00:11:00,088 --> 00:11:01,448
我们不必做这么绝
We don't have to go that far.

260
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,038
还是有其他办法的
There are other means available.

261
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:05,518
我们不能遣送他回朝鲜
We can't send him back to north korea.

262
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:07,638
他知道怎么逃出来
He knows how to get out.

263
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:10,628
我们唯一要做的是
The only thing we need to do

264
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:12,578
让这个小孩的关注点发生偏移
Is make this kim kid lose his focus.

265
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,608
不可能
Won't happen.

266
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:15,868
他除了物理以外什么都没有兴趣
He is not interested in anything but physics.

267
00:11:15,878 --> 00:11:17,128
生物怎么样?
What about biology?

268
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:20,588
什么?  你知道  性(双关语)
What? you know, biology.

269
00:11:20,918 --> 00:11:22,968
只有这件事可以完全让顶级头脑
The one thing that can completely derail

270
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:24,178
偏离轨道
A world-class mind.

271
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:25,618
霍华德  他才15岁
Howard, he's 15.

272
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:26,428
是的  怎么了
Yeah, so?

273
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:28,148
我15岁的时候  遇见了迪妮斯・帕尔玛莉
When I was 15, I met denise palmeri

274
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:31,698
然后年级平均成绩从5.0降到了1.8
And my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.

275
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:34,248
她跟你上床了?
She was sleeping with you?

276
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,928
没有  我就是浪费了很多时间
No, I just wasted a lot of time

277
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:39,458
想象如果她跟我上床了会是什么样
Thinking about what it would be like if she did.

278
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:41,868
太好了  你们都在
Oh, good, you're all here.

279
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:44,168
听着  我决定了  如果你们三个
Look, I've decided that if the three of you

280
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:46,228
放弃手头的工作  跟我合作
Drop whatever it is you're working on and join me,

281
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,388
我们可以在10年内征服冷聚变
We could lick cold fusion in less than a decade.

282
00:11:48,398 --> 00:11:50,408
绝对不用12年
12 years, tops.

283
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:55,028
走开?
Go away?

284
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,218
是在说我吗?
Could it be me?

285
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:04,728
好  各位  怎么啦
Oh, hey guys, what's up?

286
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:06,428
我们需要一个15岁的亚洲辣妹
We need a hot 15-year-old asian girl

287
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:08,498
喜欢天才男人的
With a thing for smart guys.

288
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:10,098
什么?
What?

289
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:11,148
霍华德  那是种族歧视
Howard, that's racist.

290
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:14,238
任何15岁的女孩都可以
Any 15-year-old girl will do the trick.

291
00:12:20,128 --> 00:12:22,678
可能她误解了我们
It's possible she may have misunderstood us.

292
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,032
库珀博士
Dr. cooper.

293
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,122
我们打扰你了吗
Oh, are we interrupting?

294
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:32,342
不不  请进
No, no. please come in.

295
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,072
你看了这个会喜出望外的
Yeah, I think you'll appreciate this.

296
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:35,042
非常令人振奋
This is very exciting.

297
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:35,942
你在研究什么
Oh, what are you working on?

298
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:37,132
很不寻常的东西
Something remarkable.

299
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:39,652
考虑到我在物理领域赢得诺贝尔奖的愿景
Since my prospects for the nobel prize in physics

300
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:40,432
已经不复存在
Have disappeared--

301
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:42,762
非常感谢你  我已经决定
Thank you very much-- I've decided

302
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:45,592
重新定位我的方向  运用我的社交能力
To refocus my efforts and use my people skills

303
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:46,972
去赢得诺贝尔和平奖
To win the nobel peace prize.

304
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:47,842
看着
Look.

305
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:49,732
我会在墨西哥沙漠的中心
I'm going to solve the middle east crisis

306
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:51,992
建造另一个一模一样的耶路撒冷
By building an exact replica of jerusalem

307
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:54,312
来解决中东危机
In the middle of the mexican desert.

308
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:56,592
怎么解决?
To what end?

309
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:58,252
你知道  就像拍棒球类的电影一样
You know, it's like the baseball movie.

310
00:12:58,262 --> 00:13:00,432
"只要拍  大家就都会来"
"build it and they will come."

311
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:03,012
谁会来?
Who will come?

312
00:13:03,022 --> 00:13:04,962
犹太人
The jewish people.

313
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:06,412
如果他们不来怎么办?
What if they don't come?

314
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,742
那我们就热情些  摆一个宴会
We'll make it nice, put out a spread.

315
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:10,982
好吧
Okay, well, um...

316
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:12,112
说到宴会
Speaking of spreads,

317
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:13,612
今天下午我们将为金先生准备
We're having a small welcoming party

318
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:15,552
一个小小欢迎会
This afternoon for mr. kim who's agreed

319
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,092
他已经答应进入我们大学
To join us here at the university.

320
00:13:17,102 --> 00:13:18,952
他当然答应了
Of course he has.

321
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:20,072
神使告诉我们
The oracle told us

322
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:22,322
小尼奥就是这个人
Little neo was the one.

323
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:26,072
你可以看见矩阵  是吧?
You can see the matrix, can't you?

324
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:29,272
好了  很明显你现在正忙
Okay, well, obviously you're very busy

325
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:31,122
你的...
With your, uh, um...

326
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:32,912
走吧  丹尼斯
Come, dennis.

327
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:35,452
你得原谅库珀博士
You'll have to excuse dr. cooper.

328
00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:37,802
他最近经历了很多...
He's been under a lot of, um...

329
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:39,652
他是个疯子
He's nuts.

330
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:52,322
我真的不明白你
I really don't understand

331
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,952
反对的理由  歌德法布教授
Your objections, professor goldfarb.

332
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,512
为什么索诺拉沙漠
Why wouldn't the sonora desert

333
00:13:55,522 --> 00:13:57,892
不会是一个完美的乐土呢
Make a perfectly good promised land?

334
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:00,892
走开
Go away.

335
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:04,442
我们可以叫它"新耶路撒冷"
We could call it nuevo jerusalem.

336
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,912
请走开
Please go away.

337
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:10,022
法老对摩西说
Said pharaoh to moses.

338
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:13,032
这怎么那么多小姑娘?
Why are all these young women here?

339
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,212
今天是"带你女儿来工作"日
It's take your daughter to work day.

340
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:16,142
真的?
Really?

341
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:17,342
我不知道嘛
I was not aware of that.

342
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:19,822
是的  有一份非常正式的电子邮件
Oh, yes. there was a very official e-mail

343
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:21,032
发到了每一位
That was sent to everyone

344
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:22,612
保险档案上显示
Whose insurance files indicated

345
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:25,972
自己有个14到16周岁女儿的人手上
They had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.

346
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:28,752
-漂亮  -谢谢
Smooth. thank you.

347
00:14:30,342 --> 00:14:32,792
我们的男主角来了
There's the man of the hour.

348
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:36,382
好了  我们现在让这个不擅交际的小天才
Okay, so we now have a socially-awkward genius

349
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:38,822
深陷于一屋子年龄相当且令人销魂的女孩群中了
In a room full of attractive, age-appropriate women.

350
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:41,372
他要做的就是泡上她们其中的一个
All he has to do now is hook up with one of them.

351
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,792
你们发现这个计划的瑕疵没?
Anyone else see the flaw in this plan?

352
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:54,602
我们需要社交方面的催化剂
We need a social catalyst.

353
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:55,632
比如?
Like what?

354
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:58,402
我们可不能把15岁的女孩弄醉
We can't get 15-year-old girls drunk.

355
00:14:58,572 --> 00:14:59,152
我们能啊
Or can we?

356
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:01,132
不  我们不能
No, we can't.

357
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:02,872
我想你不是说"我们不能"
I don't think you mean "we can't."

358
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:04,762
而是说"我们不应该"
I think you mean "we shouldn't."

359
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:07,602
霍华德  你是个犹太人
Hey, howard, you're a jew.

360
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:09,312
如果有另外一面哭墙
If there was another wailing wall

361
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:10,902
和在耶路撒冷的一模一样
Exactly like the one in jerusalem

362
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:13,652
不过比较靠近炸玉米卷摊和卖便宜处方药的药店
But close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs,

363
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,092
你还会对着那面墙哀哭吗
Would you still be able to wail at it?

364
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:20,472
好吧  又是我没事找事
Okay, it's definitely me.

365
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:23,862
我们不能等着老天来决定了
Okay, we cannot leave this to chance.

366
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:25,332
咱们来挑个女孩
Let's pick a girl and figure out

367
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,842
然后琢磨下怎么让她和丹尼斯搞到一起
How to get her together with dennis.

368
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:30,092
对  那个怎么样?
Okay, how about that one?

369
00:15:30,282 --> 00:15:31,682
我对这一类的太了解了
Uh-uh. I know the type.

370
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:34,102
拉拉队长  学生会干事  总是跟运动员约会
Cheerleader, student council, goes out with the jocks,

371
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:36,182
甚至看都不会看那些天才班里的人
Won't even look at anybody in the gifted program.

372
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:37,612
之后如果  你苦苦哀求她两年
And if, after two years of begging,

373
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:38,742
她终于愿意跟你约会
She does agree to go out with you,

374
00:15:38,752 --> 00:15:39,642
结果却也是一个事先设计好的骗局
It turns out to be a setup and you're in the backseat

375
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:41,202
你光着屁股坐在你妈汽车的后座上时
Of your mom's car with your pants off

376
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:44,032
会有整个橄榄球队队员过来嘲笑你的...
While the whole football team laughs at y...

377
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:47,812
你在哭吗
Are you crying?

378
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,362
没有  有点过敏罢了
No, I have allergies.

379
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:54,522
好吧  那这个怎么样?
Okay, um, oh, hey, how about her?

380
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:57,532
可以  如果他想帮她写个几年作业
Sure, if he wants to spend a couple years

381
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:59,312
而那些时候她通常已经用白俄罗斯人(一种鸡尾酒)
Doing her homework while she drinks herself

382
00:15:59,322 --> 00:16:01,772
把自己灌得不省人事了
Into a stupor with nonfat white russians.

383
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:02,872
而你还得扶着她的头从厕所出来
And you're the one holding her head

384
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:04,332
她会一边吐一边告诉你说
Out of the toilet while she's puking

385
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:06,662
真希望"男的都像你这样"
And telling you she wishes "more guys were like you."

386
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:08,742
然后她会拿着你帮她写的论文顺利地进入康奈尔大学
And then she gets into cornell because you wrote her essay

387
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:10,572
当你某个周末开车去找她的时候
For her and you drive up to visit her one weekend

388
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:13,052
她却会装出一副好像从来都不认识你的样子
And she acts like she doesn't even know you.

389
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:18,112
算了  这个也不行
Okay, so not her, either.

390
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,022
那个怎么样?
Oh, hey, how about her?

391
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:22,562
有点意思  长得不错
Oh, interesting, kind of pretty,

392
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:25,092
有点胖乎乎  因此很可能不那么孤傲
A little chubby, so probably low self-esteem.

393
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:26,282
我看就是她了
I think that's our girl.

394
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:28,082
咱们谁过去跟她搭话
One of us should go talk to her.

395
00:16:28,092 --> 00:16:29,832
我不可能跟她搭话  你去吧
I can't talk to her-- you do it.

396
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:32,122
我怎么可能就这么过去跟她搭话
I can't just go up and talk to her.

397
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:33,952
霍华德  你去吧
Howard, you talk to her.

398
00:16:34,182 --> 00:16:35,732
不好说  一旦让她瞄到我的话
I don't know, she'll never go for the kid

399
00:16:35,742 --> 00:16:37,852
她肯定不会去找那小孩了
Once she gets a peek at this.

400
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,632
知道吗  如果在印度  这就简单多了
You know, if we were in india, this would be simpler.

401
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:43,852
跟她父亲谈五分钟  20头山羊  一台笔记本电脑
Five minutes with her dad, 20 goats and a laptop,

402
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:45,702
一切搞定
And we'd be done.

403
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:47,112
可我们不在印度啊
Well, we're not in india.

404
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:48,972
好啊  那我们看看你要怎么办
All right, why don't we do it your way then?

405
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:49,782
我们安排这个女孩搬到
We'll arrange for this girl

406
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:51,372
与丹尼斯只有一走廊之隔的地方
To move in across the hall from dennis

407
00:16:51,382 --> 00:16:54,642
让他可以像哈巴狗一样几个月不停地为她倾倒
So he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.

408
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:57,312
好  那确实没有道理
Okay, that was uncalled for.

409
00:16:57,322 --> 00:16:59,172
是你先开始的  哥们
You started it, dude.

410
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:03,072
请大家听我说好吗
Could I have everyone's attention, please?

411
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:06,492
这是一个多么美妙的场合
What a wonderful occasion this is,

412
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:08,282
我们十分幸运能有机会
And how fortunate that it should happen to fall

413
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,582
来参加"带你女儿来工作"日
On take your daughter to work day.

414

415
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:15,772
丹尼斯・金先生加入我们这个小家庭

416

417
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:19,742
金先生
Mr. kim

418
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:23,212
不仅是在斯坦福大学毕业典礼上发言的毕业生
Was not only the valedictorian at stanford university,

419
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:25,722
他更是极具声望的史蒂文森奖
He is also the youngest recipient

420
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:28,172
有史以来最年轻的获得者
Of the prestigious stevenson award.

421
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:30,752
直到纪录被半机械人打破前最年轻的
Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!

422
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:33,612
现在  废话不多说
And now, without any further ado,

423
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:35,872
让我向大家介绍此时此刻的主角
Let me introduce the man of the hour,

424
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:38,762
丹尼斯・金先生
Mr. dennis kim.

425
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:42,252
丹尼斯?
Dennis?

426
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:43,742
丹尼斯
Dennis!

427
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:45,502
干什么?
What?!

428
00:17:46,342 --> 00:17:47,412
你能不能向大家
Would you like to tell us

429
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:49,252
稍微介绍下你近期的研究?
A little bit about your upcoming research?

430
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:50,232
算了吧  谢了
No, thanks.

431
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:52,102
我得跟爱玛去趟购物中心
I'm going to the mall with emma.

432
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,442
那孩子搞到了一个
The kid got a girl.

433
00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:02,252
难以置信
Unbelievable.

434
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,502
你们谁看到他是怎么做的了吗
Did anyone see how he did it?

435
00:18:06,512 --> 00:18:08,492
别担心  看我的
Don't worry, I've got this.

436
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:10,482
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

437
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:13,772
尊敬的女儿们  当金先生
Honored daughters, while mr. kim,

438
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:15,812
因为他的年幼和无知
By virtue of his youth and naivete,

439
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:17,962
被人类交往中一种神秘的需求所俘虏时
Has fallen prey to the inexplicable need

440
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,102
请允许我插两句
For human contact, let me step in

441
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:23,192
我向你们保证我的研究会不间断地继续下去的
And assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted,

442
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,032
而那些人际关系的种种将会继续困惑
And that social relationships will continue to baffle

443
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:28,152
并且排斥我
And repulse me.

444
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:30,882
谢谢
Thank you.

445
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:33,812
他回来了
He's back.

446
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,252
是啊  任务完成了
Yeah, mission accomplished.

447
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:36,062
别提这任务了
Forget the mission.

448
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:39,212
那小屁孩自己是怎么吊上马子的?
How did that little yutz get a girl on his own?

449
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:41,652
我想现在已经不是我们年轻时的那个时代了
I guess times have changed since we were young.

450
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,252
天才也性感了
Smart is the new sexy.

451
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:46,242
那为什么我们每天晚上还是孤身一人回家?
Then why do we go home alone every night?

452
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:47,912
我们也还是天才啊
We're still smart.

453
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:49,692
也许我们太天才了
Maybe we're too smart.

454
00:18:49,702 --> 00:18:51,942
天才到了物极必反的地步
So smart it's off-putting.

455
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,932
是  说得没错
Yeah, let's go with that.

456
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:00,665
简直不敢相信
Unbelievable.

457
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:01,835
我制造的元件
Components I built

458
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:04,105
已经用在了国际空间站上  而我只得到了一张
Are on the international space station and I get a ticket

459
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:06,335
公园里发射模型火箭的门票
For launching a model rocket in the park.

460
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,335
我不知道这张票对于
I don't know if the ticket was

461
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:08,705
来这里发射是不是那么重要
So much for the launch as it was

462
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,265
因为你会对着女警说
For you telling the policewoman,

463
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,375
"你得搜搜我的身
"you have to frisk me.

464
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:14,235
我裤裆里还有个火箭"
I have another rocket in my pants."

465
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:15,955
你们看那儿
Hey, look at that.

466
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:19,195
是丹尼斯・金
It's dennis kim.

467
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,295
我差点认不出他了
Wow, I almost didn't recognize him.

468
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:25,275
我们对他做了那些我感到有些愧疚
You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him.

469
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:31,335
没错  我们真的毁了他的一生
Yeah, we really ruined his life.

470
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:35,335
去他的  是他弱
Screw him-- he was weak.
