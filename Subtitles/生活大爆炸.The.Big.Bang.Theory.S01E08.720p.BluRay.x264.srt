00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:13,566
该死的walletnook.com!
Damn you,walletnook.Com!

2
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:15,896
有什么问题吗?
Problem?

3
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:18,346
网站上的产品说明 完全是在误导
The online description was completely misleading.

4
00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:21,256
上面说 有八个插缝 加一个可抽取的ID卡夹
They said eight slots,plus removable id.

5
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:24,226
对任何理性人来说 那意味着可以放九张卡
To any rational person,that would mean room for nine cards,

6
00:00:24,236 --> 00:00:27,596
但上面没告诉你 可抽取的ID卡夹也占了一个插缝
but they don't tell you,the removable id takes up one slot.

7
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:29,146
简直是恶梦!
It's a nightmare!

8
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:32,006
好吧 你真的需要那张 
Okay,now,do you really need

9
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:34,736
美国荣誉审判联盟的会员卡吗?
the honorary justice league of america membership card?

10
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:38,756
从5岁起就一直 存放在我的钱包里
It's been in every wallet I've owned since I was five.

11
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:40,706
为什么?
Why?

12
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:42,966
它上面写着"请随时随身携持本证"
It says "keep this on your person at all times."

13
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:46,846
就在蝙蝠侠签名的下面
it's right here under batman's signature.

14
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:52,446
…这就是莱纳德和谢尔顿的房间
…And this is leonard and sheldon's apartment.

15

猜猜谁的父母刚装了宽带
Guess whose parents just got broadband.

16
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:57,486
莱纳德 容我介绍 新德里现场连线

你们好!
Hi!

19
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:03,346
把摄像头抬起来! 我正在看他的裤裆
Tilt up the camera up! I'm looking at his crotch.

20
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:04,366
抱歉 爸爸
Sorry,papa.

21
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:05,616
噢 好多了
Oh,that's much better.

他和莱纳德住一起
He lives with leonard.

26
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,626
噢 真不错
Oh,that's nice.

27
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:15,406
就像哈罗恩和塔维尔一样
Like haroon and tanvir.

28
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,006
不 不 跟哈罗恩和塔维尔不一样
No,no. Not like haroon and tanvir.

29
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:18,576
多么可爱的年轻人啊
Such sweet young men.

30
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:22,066
他们刚刚收养了一个很可爱的小印度男孩
They just adopted the cutest little punjabi baby.

31
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:24,506
不是 我们跟哈罗恩和塔维尔不一样
No,we're not like haroon and tanvir.

32
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:27,616
你们和我儿子一样 是搞研究的?
So,are you boys academics like our son?

33
00:01:27,626 --> 00:01:28,426
是的
Yes.

34
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:31,436
你们父母对你们那点可怜收入也无所谓吗?
And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential?

35
00:01:31,446 --> 00:01:32,816
- 哦 是的 - 完全不
- Oh,yes. - Not at all.

36
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:34,766
爸爸 拜托 不要再提这些了
Papa,please. Don't start.

37
00:01:34,776 --> 00:01:36,286
只是随便问问
It was just a question.

38
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,126
他太敏感了
He's so sensitive.

39
00:01:37,136 --> 00:01:38,416
好啦 这就是我的生活 他们是我的朋友
Okay,that's my life. That's my friends.

43
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:45,876
你关之前 我们还有个好消息要告诉你

44
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:48,766
把电脑放下 把你朋友们聚过来
Put the computer down and gather your friends.

45
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:55,106
- 什么 爸爸? - 我没看到你朋友
- What is it,papa? -I don't see your friends.

46
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:00,406
你们不觉得网上聊天 
Is it just me,or does web chatting

47
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:02,706
穿着衣服很无聊吗?
with your clothes on seem a little pointless?

48
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:05,866
拉杰 你还记得拉丽塔・古塔吗?
Rajesh,do you remember lalita gupta?

49
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,746
那个用萨摩萨饼打我 还叫我贱民的小肥妞?
The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable?

50
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:10,486
是的
Yes.

51
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:13,046
她现在在南加州大学 学牙科专业
Well,now she's a dental student at usc,

52
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:15,956
我们把你的联系方式给了她
so we gave her your contact information.

53
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:17,196
你们干嘛那么做?
Why did you do that?

54
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:18,496
你已经26岁了 拉杰
You're 26 years old,rajesh.

55
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:19,946
我们想抱孙子
We want grandchildren.

56
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:21,316
可是爸爸 我不想...
But,papa,I'm not supposed...

57
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:23,896
拉丽塔的父母同意了你们的婚事
lalita's parents approved the match.

58
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:27,286
如果你决定春天举办婚礼 还可以避开雨季
If you decide on a spring wedding,we can avoid monsoon season.

59
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:28,466
春天就结婚?
A spring wedding?

60
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:29,406
你自己决定 孩子
It's up to you,dear.

61
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,646
我们可不想干涉
We don't want to meddle.

62
00:02:30,676 --> 00:02:32,836
既然你们不想干涉 干嘛要干涉我的事?
If you don't want to meddle,then why are you meddling?

63
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:35,676
我说一句 你父母可能不认为这是干涉
If I may,your parents probably don't consider this meddling.

64
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:37,776
包办婚姻如今虽已不常见
While arranged marriages are no longer the norm,

65
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:40,306
但印度父母仍然在他们子女的婚姻中 
indian parents continue to have

66
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:42,096
扮演着比以往更重要的角色
a greater-than-average involvement in their children's love lives.

67
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:44,726
为什么我们自己文化还要你来教导?
Why are you telling me about my own culture?

68
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:47,406
你看起来很困惑
You seemed confused.

69
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:50,286
抱歉 妈妈 爸爸 尽管我非常尊重你们
Sorry,mumi,papa,but with all due respect,

70
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,646
- 但我真的不想... - 对不起 孩子
- I really don't want to... - I'm sorry,darling.

71
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:52,746
我们不能再聊了
We have to go.

72
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,966
1989-1993年的美国电视剧

73
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,966
<天才小医生>开始了 
Doogie howser is on.

74
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,996
奶奶 <小医生>时间到了!
Grandma! It's doogie time!

75
00:02:58,006 --> 00:02:59,806
- 拜拜! - 拜拜!
- Bye-bye! - Bye-bye!

76
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:04,466
真不敢相信
I don't believe it.

77
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,656
我也是
Neither do I.

78
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,526
<天才小医生>快20年没播了
Doogie howser's been off the air for like 20 years.

79
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:13,066
其实我读到过 它在印度是最受欢迎的电视节目
Actually,I read somewhere that it's one of the most popular programs in india.

80
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:15,696
我认为希望有个当医生的孩子 
It might speak to a cultural aspiration

81
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:17,396
可能是种文化向往吧
to have one's children enter the medical profession.

82
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,656
说的没错
I bet you're right.

83
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,026
我猜他们喜欢看<实习医生风云>
I bet they love scrubs.

84
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:21,256
有不喜欢的吗?
What's not to love?

85
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,956
喂! 在听吗?
Excuse me! Hello?

86
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:25,086
我父母想要我娶一个 根本不认识的人
My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger.

87
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:26,936
我该怎么办?
What am I going to do?

88
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:28,626
我建议你坦然接受吧
I suggest you go through with it.

89
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:29,696
什么?
What?

90
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:32,046
建立在浪漫爱情上的婚姻 
Romantic love as the basis for marriage

91
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,196
只是从19世纪开始盛行
has only existed since the 19th century.

92
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:36,286
在那之前都是包办婚姻 
Up until then,arranged marriages were the norm,

93
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:38,376
也很好地适应了社会发展
and it served society quite well.

94
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,146
1964年著名的百老汇长篇音乐剧

95
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,146
那正是<屋顶上的小提琴手>的蓝本
It's the entire premise of fiddler on the roof.

96
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:43,356
我不是音乐剧的粉丝 但我超爱那部音乐剧
I'm not a big fan of musicals,but I love that show.

97
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:44,266
我也是
Me too.

98
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:46,016
当然 对我来说很有文化感染力
Of course,it speaks to me culturally.

99
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:50,596
可以理解 但这类故事一般都超越了种族
Understandable,but there's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity.

100
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,566
让人没法忘记里面那些 琅琅上口的曲调
Let's not forget it's got some really catchy tunes.

101
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:53,856
- 噢 的确 - 就是啊!

102

好吧 我知道该怎么做了
Okay,I know what I'm going to do.

103
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:56,646
什么?
What?

104
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:58,636
去找新朋友
Find new friends.

105
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:05,716
那谁去租那部音乐剧?
so who wants to rent fiddler?

106
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:07,956
没必要 我们有特别收藏版
No need,we have the special edition.

107
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:12,656
也许我们真的就像哈罗恩和塔维尔
Well,maybe we are like haroon and tanvir.

108
00:04:31,326 --> 00:04:35,316
《生活大爆炸》

110
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:42,884
我想取消天文馆的会员资格
Yeah,I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium.

111
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:49,454
我也很抱歉 但我钱包里没地方放你们的会员卡了
Well,I'm sorry,too,but there's just no room for you in my wallet.

112
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:55,534
我能理解 但我要在 你们和自然历史博物馆中选择
I understand,but it was between you and the museum of natural history,

113
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:58,324
坦白说 你们那儿可没有恐龙
and frankly,you don't have dinosaurs.

114
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:01,884
我也会想你的 再见
I'll miss you,too. Bye-bye.

Okay,I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to stop.

116
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:11,954
天呐 我彻底完蛋了
oh,dear,I am rightly and truly screwed.

嗨 我以为你去找新朋友了

我是有伸出触角(尝试过)
I've got some feelers out.

119
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,734
在此同时 听听这个
In the meantime,listen to this.

120
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:21,084
嗨 拉杰 我是拉丽塔・古塔

121
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:24,604

Uh,your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me.

122
00:05:24,614 --> 00:05:29,924

So,I'm calling you and… call me back. Bye.

123
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:33,754
你们能相信吗 她居然逼得那么紧
Can you believe how pushy she is?

124
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,314
那就别回她电话
So don't call her.

125
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:39,724
如果不打给她 我就再也别想和我父母说话了
If I don't call her,I won't hear the end of it from my parents.

126
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:40,344
那就打给她
So call her.

127
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:42,834
我怎么打给她? 你知道我不能和女人说话
How can I call her? You know I can't talk to women.

128
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:45,324

你现在穿的什么?
So what are you wearing?

136
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:09,894
噢 那不重要
Oh,not important.

137
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:13,344
总之 你想什么时候见面?
Uh,so,anyhow,when would you like to meet?

138
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:16,334
周五没问题
Friday works for me!

139
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:19,784
具体时间地点 我再打给你
I'll call you with a time and place.

140
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:22,914
还有 我是认真的 宝贝
But in the meantime,keep it real,babe.

141
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:31,174
现在你可以感激我了
You may now thank me.

142
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:34,884
谢什么? 把我的声音弄得像 辛普森一家似的?
For what? Making me sound like a simpsons character?

143
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,074
那好吧 下次你自己去约她
Fine. Next time make your own date.

144
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:38,454
这次我都不想!
I didn't want to make this one!

145
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,144
往好的方面想吧 也许她已经是个美丽动人的姑娘呢
Look on the bright side,she might turn out to be a nice,beautiful girl.

146
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:43,474
好极了 那我们就会结婚
Great,then we'll get married,

147
00:06:43,484 --> 00:06:44,604
但我一句话都没办法跟她说
I won't be able to talk to her

148
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:47,894
我们一起的余生就会沉默中度过
and we'll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.

149
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:49,904
我父母就是这样
It worked for my parents.

150
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:52,634
- 嗨 伙计们 - 嗨
- hi,guys. - Oh,hey.

151
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:53,874
我需要几只"豚鼠"做实验
I need some guinea pigs.

152
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:58,604
在洛杉矶瑞赛达有家供应实验动物的公司 你可以去试试
Okay,there's a lab animal supply company in reseda you could try.

153
00:06:58,614 --> 00:07:00,734
但如果你的研究需要人类志愿者
But if your research is going to have human applications,

154
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:02,444
我能建议你换成小白鼠吗?
may I suggest white mice instead?

155
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:05,594
它们大脑的机能和人类的更接近
Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.

156
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:08,394
我向上帝发誓 谢尔顿 总有一天
I swear to god,sheldon,one day,

157
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:10,764
我会跟上你的说话思维
I'm going to get the hang of talking to you.

158
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:14,344
这话他妈妈说了好多年了
His mom's been saying that for years.

159
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:17,164
什么事?
What's up?

160
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:20,264
好吧 我总算说服餐馆老板 把我换到吧台
Well,I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bartending shift,

161
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,434
所以我需要练习调酒
so I need to practice mixing drinks.

162
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:23,034
哦 太好了
Oh,great.

163
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:26,494
任何事情的成功关键 都是熟能生巧
Well,the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.

164
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:29,164
显然也有例外
With certain obvious exceptions.

165
00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:31,904
比如说 自杀
Suicide,for example.

166
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,334
莱纳德 怎么样?
So,leonard,how about it?

167
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:38,394
你知道 佩妮 我们很乐意帮助你
You know,penny,we'd love to help you,

168
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:40,814
但拉杰现在正遇到了点麻烦
but 拉杰 is going through some stuff right now,

169
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:43,284
而且他不喝酒 所以...
and besides,he doesn't drink,so...

170
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:46,514
是吗?
really?

171
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:53,034
拉杰现在很痛苦 所以愿意尝试喝酒
Um,raj is going through some stuff right now and he'd like to take up drinking.

172
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:57,024
好了 给你 莱纳德
Okay,here you go,leonard.

173
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:58,864
龙舌兰日出酒

174
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:00,194
谢谢
Thank you.

175
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:01,964
知道吗 这杯酒能极好地诠释
You know,this drink is a wonderful example of

176
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:03,604
在各自不同重力下 
how liquids with different specific gravities

177
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:06,504
液体是如何在圆柱容器内相互作用的
interact in a cylindrical container.

178
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:09,644
谢谢
Thank you.

179
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:12,474
好吧 拉杰 你要什么?
Okay,raj,what'll it be?

180
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:16,324
随便你推荐
Whatever you recommend.

181
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:17,454
草蜢酒怎么样?
Uh,how about a grasshopper?

182
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,484
草蜢酒我很在行
I make a mean grasshopper.

183
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:20,974
行吗? 好的
Okay? Good.Coming up.

184
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:22,804
谢尔顿 你要什么?
Sheldon,what are you going to have?

185
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:25,034
我要一杯无糖可乐
I'll have a diet coke.

186
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:27,534
好吧 你能点鸡尾酒吗?
Okay,can you please order a cocktail?

187
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:29,464
我需要练习调酒
I need to practice mixing drinks.

188
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:30,114
好吧
Fine.

189
00:08:30,124 --> 00:08:32,954
我要圣洁古巴利布瑞酒
I'll have a virgin cuba libre.

190
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:37,344
那是朗姆可乐酒 去掉朗姆酒
That's,um,rum and coke without the rum.

191
00:08:37,354 --> 00:08:38,584
对
Yes.

192
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:42,374
- 那么...可乐 - 是的
- So...coke. - Yes.

193
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:45,654
能调制成无糖的吗?
And would you make it diet?

194
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,654
冰箱里有罐装的
There's a can in the fridge.

195
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:56,944
古巴利布瑞酒通常是用高脚杯盛放 并且杯口放上酸橙
A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.

196
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,084
那你游去古巴吧
Then swim to cuba.

197
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:03,964
吧台侍者应该热情待人才对
Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.

198
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:06,424
好啦
Okay.

199
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,224
拉杰 给你
Raj,here you go.

200
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:09,744
好啦 下一个到谁?
All right. Who's next?

201
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:12,304
我想试试 光滑的咪咪
I'd like to try a slippery nipple.

202
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:19,104
好吧 跳过你了
Okay,you're cut off.

203
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:22,964
谁要续杯?
Anybody need a refill?

204
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:25,324
我的人生驶向何方 佩妮?
Where did my life go,penny?

205
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:28,724
眼下我还是无忧无虑的单身汉
One day I'm a carefree bachelor,

206
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,474
转眼我就结婚了 载着一车小孩 
and the next I'm married and driving a minivan

207
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:33,484
去新德里郊区打板球
to peewee cricket matches in suburban new delhi.

208
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:37,854
你在跟我说话?
Are you talking to me?

209
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:40,304
这儿还有别人叫佩妮?
Is there another penny here?

210
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:42,564
我有计划
I had such plans.

211
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:43,844
我有梦想
I had dreams.

212
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:47,474
我要成为粒子天体物理学界的甘地
I was going to be the indira gandhi of particle astrophysics.

213
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:49,814
当然是有小鸡鸡的
But with a penis,of course.

214
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,844
太神了
Amazing.

215
00:09:52,854 --> 00:09:54,074
我还小的时候
Ever since I was a little boy,

216
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:57,154
我爸就想让我像他一样当妇科医生
my father wanted me to be a gynecologist like him.

217
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:58,734
我哪能做妇科医生?
How can I be a gynecologist?

218
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:01,644
我都不敢看女人的眼睛!
I can barely look a woman in the eye!

219
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:05,864
知道吗?
You know what?

220
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:08,394
我再也不要父母控制我的人生了
I'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer.

221
00:10:08,404 --> 00:10:10,194
是时候摊牌了
It's time for a showdown.

222
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:12,674
谁给我一个带摄像头的电脑!
Somebody give me a computer with a webcam!

223
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:16,674
亲爱的 我觉得这是酒劲儿的作用
Okay,sweetie,I think that's the grasshopper talking.

224
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:17,944
我要告诉我父母
And it's about to tell my parents that

225
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:21,314
我绝不会跟拉丽塔・古塔 骑象走向圣坛（结婚）
I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with lalita gupta.

226
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:23,424
好啦 冷静
Okay,calm down.

227
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:26,494
没人能逼你结婚
Look,no one can make you get married.

228
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:28,784
不如跟她见见面 看会怎么样?
Why don't you just meet this girl and see what happens?

229
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,814
你没听我说吗?
Haven't you been listening to me?

230
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:31,384
我不能跟女人说话
I cannot talk to women.

231
00:10:31,394 --> 00:10:32,394
呃 拉杰
Um,raj...

232
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:34,714
别说 看他多久才醒悟
no,no,let's see how long it takes him.

233
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:39,204
拉杰 亲爱的 你说你不能跟女人说话
Um,raj,honey,you say you can't talk to women,

234
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:41,234
可你一直在跟我说话
but you've been talking to me.

235
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:43,504
这将是个永远的谜
And now we'll never know.

236
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:46,504
说的对...
You're right. I...

237
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:49,194
我正在和你说话
I am talking to you.

238
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:51,744
你好 佩妮 怎么样?
Hello,penny,how are you?

239
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:53,894
我很好
I'm fine.

240
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:57,974
现在我只需确保 和草蜢酒见面之前 先喝一杯拉丽塔
Okay,now I just need to make sure I have a lalita before I meet the grasshopper.

241
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:04,144
真是甜蜜的绿色奇迹
It's a sweet,green miracle.

242
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:06,244
好吧 如果你要靠酒撑过这次约会
Okay,if you're going to drink on this date,

243
00:11:06,254 --> 00:11:08,254
答应我不要太过头
just promise me you won't overdo it.

244
00:11:08,264 --> 00:11:09,734
什么过头?
Overdo what?

245
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:11,254
快乐过头?
Happiness?

246
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:13,364
自由过头?
Freedom?

247
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:18,604
能保证我一切都将顺利无比的 这股体内热流?
This warm glow inside of me that promises everything's going to be all hunky-dunky?

248
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:20,834
没错
Yeah,that.

249
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:22,034
你带她来我的餐馆吧
Why don't you bring her to my restaurant

250
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:24,184
我在吧台可以照看你们
while I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you.

251
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:25,844
好
Okay.

252
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:28,214
等等 你们什么计划?
Wait a minute. What's the plan here?

253
00:11:28,224 --> 00:11:30,034
让他俩见面 他喜欢她 娶她
Let's say he meets her,he likes her,they get married.

254
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:33,224
然后在酒精的麻痹下度过余生?
What's he going to do,stay drunk for the rest of his life?

255
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,504
我父母就是这样
Worked for my parents.

256
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:49,892
不敢相信小拉丽塔・古塔就坐在我旁边
I can't believe I'm sitting here next to little lalita gupta.

257
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:52,492
事实如此了
Well,you are.

258
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:54,812
小拉丽塔
Little lalita.

259
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,942
说起来很好玩
That's fd of kinun to say.

260
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:59,652
小拉丽塔 小拉丽塔 小拉丽塔
Little lalita,little lalita,little lalita.

261
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:01,132
你可以试试
You should try it.

262
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:02,752
不用了
Oh,it's okay.

263
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:08,122
你瘦了好多啊
You have lost so much weight.

264
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:12,462
肯定吃了不少苦头吧 因为你以前好胖好胖
That must have been difficult for you because you were so,so fat.

265
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:15,462
你还记得吗?
Do you remember?

266
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:16,652
我记得
Yes,I do.

267
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:17,402
当然记得了
Of course you do.

268
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:20,042
肥成那样 谁能忘得了?
Who could forget being that fat?

269
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,532
我一直在努力忘记
Well,I've been trying.

270
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,752
你现在学牙科了
So you're a dental student.

271
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:31,952
你知道吗? 牙医的自杀率特别高
Mm,are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate?

272
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:34,892
当然没有空中交通管制员高
Not as high as,say,air traffic controllers,but,then,

273
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:37,012
但是牙医要比空中交通管制员多很多
there are far mo dreentists than air traffic controllers,

274
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,622
所以单就数量来说 还是你们胜出
so in pure numbers,you're still winning.

275
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:41,292
是啊!
Yay,me.

276
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:45,322
你有没有什么酒能让他轻点闹腾?
Do you have a drink that will make him less obnoxious?

277
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,722
酒是没有这种功能的
Drinks do not work that way.

278
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:50,262
我觉得他没问题 看她
I'd say he's doing fine. Look at her.

279
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:54,342
上次我妈给我找的女孩 是个留着胡子的秃子
The last girl my mom set me up with had a mustache and a vestigial tail.

280
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:57,582
对不起 我来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

281
00:12:57,592 --> 00:12:58,532
怎么了?
What happened?

282
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,922
没什么 我就是有点不太想来
Nothing. I just really didn't want to come.

283
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,932
请来一杯"圣洁无糖古巴利布瑞酒"
Virgin diet cuba libre,please.

284
00:13:06,122 --> 00:13:06,932
好吧
Okay.

285
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:10,002
用高脚杯 要插柠檬片
In a tall glass with a lime wedge.

286
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,812
我这就插
Oh,I'll wedge it right in there.

287
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:16,372
库萨帕里怎么样…
So how's koothrappali...

288
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:18,032
噢 我的天
oh,my lord.

289
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:18,902
什么?
What?

290
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:21,112
这是潘查理公主
That's princess panchali.

291
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:22,902
我很确定她叫拉丽塔
I'm pretty sure her name's lalita.

292
00:13:22,912 --> 00:13:27,362
不是 是<猴子与公主>里的潘查理公主
No,no,princess panchali,from the monkey and the princess.

293
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:28,362
哦 对
Oh,yeah.

294
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:31,772
我想在网上看来着 不过要信用卡的
I tried to watch that online,but they wanted my credit card.

295
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:34,642
那是儿童故事
It's a children's story.

296
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,642
不 它不是
Oh,no,it isn't.

297
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:41,392
我小时候有一次生了病
When I was a little boy and got sick,

298
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:44,252
我经常生病 我妈妈会读这个故事给我听
which was most of the time,my mother would read it to me.

299
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:47,532
讲述一只与众不同而遭同类取笑的猴子
It's about an indian princess who befriends a monkey

300
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,792
后来和印度公主成为好朋友的故事
who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different.

301
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:53,612
因为某些原因 它引起我的强烈的共鸣
For some reason,I related to it quite strongly.

302
00:13:54,362 --> 00:13:56,472
我知道原因
I know the reason.

303
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:59,082
我们都知道
We all know the reason.

304
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:01,842
谢尔顿 你想说什么?
Sheldon,what are you getting at?

305
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:06,142
那个女人像极了书上的潘查理li公主
That woman looks exactly like the pictures of princess panchali in the book.

306
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:10,052
多难得见到一个你喜欢的角色 活生生在眼前啊
How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?

307
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:12,422
每年动漫展上
Every year at comic-con.

308
00:14:13,342 --> 00:14:14,312
迪斯尼每天都有
Every day at disneyland.

309
00:14:14,322 --> 00:14:16,882
你都可以把白雪公主雇到家里
You can hire snow white to come to your house.

310
00:14:17,282 --> 00:14:19,872
当然 最好是家里有小孩
Of course,they prefer it if you have a kid.

311
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:21,592
伙计们
Hey,guys.

312
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:22,782
她是拉丽塔・古塔
Isth is lalita gupta.

313
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:26,272
拉丽塔 这是莱纳德 谢尔顿 霍华德 还有佩妮
Lalita,this is leonard and sheldon and howard and penny.

314
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,992
你们说多好? 她不是肥女了
Isn't it great? She isn't fat anymore.

315
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:32,402
请原谅 公主陛下 我只是一只猴子
Forgive me,your highness,for I am but a monkey,

316
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:34,302
我的天性就是爬树
and it is in my nature to climb

317
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:37,742
我不是故意在你梳头时弄乱你的头发
I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.

318
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:40,502
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

319
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:44,202
你简直是美貌的潘查理公主的真身啊
You are the living embodiment of the beautiful princess panchali.

320
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:45,802
不要开玩笑了
Oh,no kidding.

321
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:47,492
那人是谁i?
Who... who is that?

322
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:50,242
我最爱的印度童话主角
A beloved character from an indian folktale.

323
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:55,072
是我们这样的印度人 还是开赌场的印第安?
Us indian or "come to our casino" indian?

324
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:57,812
你们这样的
You indian.

325
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,122
简直太像了
The resemblance is remarkable.

326
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:05,112
我简直可以闻到你黑发上 点缀的荷花香
I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.

327
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:06,732
谢谢
Well,thanks.

328
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:09,522
我想你的味道一定也很好
I imagine you smell very nice,too.

329
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:13,212
我每天洗两次澡 洗手无数次
I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.

330
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:15,532
真的? 我也是
Really? So do I.

331
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:18,062
但你是牙科学生 他只是疯子
But you're a dentist. He's nuts.

332
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:21,192
不要骂人 拉杰
Don't be insulting,rajesh.

333
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:26,112
谢尔顿 跟我说说那个跟我长得很像的公主吧
So,sheldon,tell me more about this princess you say I look like.

334
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:30,222
传说 她的眼睛是神用星星做的
It was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars

335
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:34,602
她艳红的唇 令玫瑰都羞于开放
and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.

336
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,282
我的天
Oh,my.

337
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:37,882
滚开 谢尔顿
Back off,sheldon.

338
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:38,482
为什么?
What?

339
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:39,732
如果你再调戏我的女人
If you do not stop hitting on my lady,

340
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:42,452
你会感受到我炽热的怒火
you will feel the full extent of my wrath.

341
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,142
我没调戏她
I'm not hitting on her.

342
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,682
我也不是你的女人
And I am not your lady.

343
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:49,152
而且你也没有怒火
And you have no wrath.

344
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:51,732
你是我的女人
You are my lady.

345
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,902
我爸妈说了的
Our parents said so.

346
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:55,912
从各方面来说 我们都是百分之一百在一起了
We are,for all intents and purposes,100% hooked up.

347
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,522
好吧 有些话我跟你说清楚
Okay,let's get something straight here.

348
00:15:57,532 --> 00:16:00,692
我今天来见你完全是敷衍我父母
The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case.

349
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:03,422
我才不会嫁你这种老土人呢
I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you.

350
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:06,042
潘查理公主就是凭这种精神 
That's exactly the kind of spirit with which princess panchali

351
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:07,652
带领猴子走向自由
led the monkeys to freedom.

352
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:09,032
去他妈潘查理公主
Screw princess panchali.

353
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:10,252
不许你这么说我
Hey,you can't talk to me like that.

354
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,982
可你不是什么潘查理公主啊
But you're not princess panchali.

355
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:14,552
算你走运 否则她都能把你的头砍下来
Luckily for you-- she could have you beheaded.

356
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:16,672
谢尔顿 你饿吗?
Sheldon,are you hungry?

357
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:17,892
我想吃点东西
I could eat.

358
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:19,462
我们走
Let's go.

359
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:24,272
刚才怎么回事?
What just happened?

360
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:26,102
我也无法解释
Beats the hell out of me.

361
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:27,042
我告诉你怎么回事
I'll tell you what happened.

362
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,702
我想我学会怎么泡印度妞了
I just learned how to pick up indian chicks.

363
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:35,022
让我怎么跟拉丽塔的父母交待?
What are we supposed to say to lalita's parents?

364
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:36,202
我和她爸爸一起打高尔夫
I play golf with her father.

365
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:37,812
我都没法面对他了
I won't be able to look at him.

366
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:40,482
也许你应该看着球 爸爸
Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball,papa.

367
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:42,252
你现在懂搞笑了
Oh,now you're a funny man.

368
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:44,732
这不好笑! 搞笑先生
This is not funny,mr.Funny man.

369
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:47,512
库萨帕里医生及夫人 说句公道话
Dr.And mrs.Koothrappali,in all fairness,

370
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:49,582
也不全是拉杰的错
it wasn't entirely raj's fault.

371
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,212
这我们的家事 谢尔顿
This is a family matter,sheldon.

372
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:52,502
我是莱纳德
I'm leonard.

373
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,392
不好意思 你们老外全都一个样
Oh,sorry. You all look alike to us.

374
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:57,782
他说的对 爸爸
But he's right,papa.

375
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:59,512
听他的
Listen to him.

376
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:02,372
你! 你把一切事情都搞砸了
You! You are the one who ruined everything.

377
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:04,082
是谁? 我们看不见
Who is it? We can't see.

378
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:06,382
转过去 转过去
Turn us. Turn us.

379
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:12,032
说吧 告诉我父母 为什么他们抱不上孙子
Go ahead,tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren.

380
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:12,952
我怎么知道?
How would I know?

381
00:17:12,962 --> 00:17:15,082
你精子量不足?
Do you have a low sperm count?

382
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:18,912
跟我的精子量完全没关系
This has nothing to do with my sperm count.

383
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:21,932
我们寄给你的四角裤你穿着吧 拉杰?
You are wearing the boxers that we sent you,aren't you,rajesh?

384
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:22,712
穿着呢 妈妈
Yes,mumi.

385
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:26,902
穿那种紧身三角裤对小鸡鸡不好
Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear tighty-whities.

386
00:17:27,592 --> 00:17:30,052
能不能别提我的睾丸?
Can we please stop talking about my testicles?

387
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,022
谢尔顿 告诉他们你做了什么
Sheldon,tell them what you did.

388
00:17:32,032 --> 00:17:33,492
我做了什么?
What did I do?

389
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:35,372
你抢走了他的约会对象
You left with his date.

390
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:37,712
朋友之间不能这样
Friends don't do that to each other.

391
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:41,612
好吧 知道了
All right,noted.

392
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,232
对不起
Sorry.

393
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:45,992
对不起? 你就说一个对不起完事?
Sorry? That's all you can say is sorry?

394
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:48,632
接受吧 拉杰 我连一句对不起都没收到过
Take it,raj. It's more than I've ever gotten.

395
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:51,162
我能否指出 她本来不会跟我走
And may I point out,she woavdn't hule asked me to go with her

396
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:52,922
如果你不是喝醉了又说一些令人讨厌的话
if you hadn't been drunk and boring.

397
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:53,642
喝醉?
Drunk?

398
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:56,152
还有令人讨厌 她的原话
And boring-- her words.

399
00:17:56,372 --> 00:17:57,082
我就知道!
I knew it.

400
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:59,212
他去了美国 变成酒鬼了
He moves to america and he becomes an alcoholic.

401
00:17:59,222 --> 00:18:00,822
我不是酒鬼
I'm not an alcoholic.

402
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:02,342
那你为什么喝醉?
Then why were you drunk?

403
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:04,932
就这一次 我发誓 爸爸
It was just this one time,papa,I swear.

404
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:05,922
你还否认？
Are you in denial?

405
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:08,062
要不要我们亲自去教育教育你?
Do we have to come over and do an intervention?

406
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:10,832
别让他在朋友面前丢脸
Don't embarrass him in front of his friends.

407

都是我早就知道的东西 然后我回家
nothing I didn't already know-- and I came home.

不敢相信 他中了什么邪?
I don't believe it. What's gotten into him?

428

也许一点圣洁古巴利布瑞酒 让他变得放浪了
maybe a couple virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty.

429
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:32,441
